This novel spatio-temporal MEM is able to successfully capture the changes of the halibut distribution and abundance over time and space for all available data with the exception of the first two years, including two different types of survey designs. It is the only model examined within that is able to include all this information in a unified framework while extracting the maximum amount of information from the available data as possible. Furthermore, since this model is able to output both station-specific estimated catch rate and an overall estimated catch rate for the entire region, it both increases the amount of information available to manage this fishery while being directly comparable to current methods utilized to obtain an index of abundance.

The current stock assessment model requires the indices of abundance to be biomass instead of numbers of fish caught or catch rates [@DFO2021], meaning that the estimated catch rates from this model cannot be directly utilized by this model. However, as the dataset contain average fish weight by tow, the output is a very straightforward transformation away from having catch rates in biomass per hook per minute instead of in number of fish, which are then much more applicable and can still retain and propagate uncertainties forward through the delta method [@Bickel2015].

Similarly to previous versions of the MEM, our spatio-temporal MEM and our analysis of its performance on the Atlantic halibut fishery emphasizes the importance of accounting for the abundance of non-target species for a multivariate approach. The inability to estimate the probability of non-target escapes without hook condition information, illustrated very well in the fits that do not include the stratified dataset, demonstrates this impact very well. This underlines the importance of having a reliable estimate of the abundance of these non-target species. The modelling output themselves show that overestimating the abundance of these non-target species will likely result in an underestimation of the halibut population abundance, underestimating their abundance would likely result in the opposite, and completely ignoring them is likely to result in unpredictable and variable biases.

A key outcome from this analysis is that there is evidence that, while the fixed stations were likely appropriate to capture the large changes of halibut abundance, they are likely not capturing changes in distribution and abundance of non-target species which will subsequently impact the estimation of halibut abundance. As the longline gear catches a great number of other species (e.g., cod, dogfish, etc.), it is not too surprising that their overall joint spatial distribution would shift which, as we have shown, would then have an impact on the halibut catch rates. The timing of the implementation of the stratified random sampling design (2017) therefore appears to be fortunate, as those are the years where the fixed stations seem to be missing the shift in abundance of non-target species. This new design does capture these changes, allowing the model to therefore get a more accurate estimate of the underlying halibut abundance. Furthermore, the estimates from the stratified random design will only get more accurate and precise as years are added into the time series.

While it was developed for this specific longline survey, this model could easily be applied to any longline fisheries or other passive sampling gear that would be impacted by hook or bait competition and promises to improve indices of abundance used for stock assessment models. Depending on the fishery, it could be of great value to further modify the multinomial equation used by our approach to expand on the non-target species to include multiple specific species. More specifically, if there are a finite amount of other species being caught aside from the target, it would likely lead to improvements in estimated catch rates for the target species.
