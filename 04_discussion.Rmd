This novel spatio-temporal MEM is able to successfully capture the changes of the halibut distribution and abundance over time and space for the vast majority of the data available, including two different types of survey designs. It is the only model examined within that is able to include all this information in a unified framework while extracting the maximum amount of information from the available data as possible. Furthermore, since this model is able to output both station-specific estimated catch rate and an overall estimated catch rate for the entire region, it both increases the amount of information available to manage this fishery while being directly comparable to current methods utilized to obtain an index of abundance.

The current stock assessment model requires the indices of abundance to be biomass instead of numbers of fish caught or catch rates [@DFO2021], meaning that the estimated catch rates from this model cannot be directly utilized by this model. However, as the dataset contain average fish weight by tows, the output is a very straightforward transformation away from having catch rates in biomass per hook per minute instead of in number of fish, which are then much more applicable and can still retain and propagate uncertainties forward through the delta method [@Bickel2015].

Similarly to previous versions of the MEM, our spatio-temporal MEM and our analysis of its performance on the Atlantic halibut fishery emphasizes the importance of accounting for the abundance of non-target species for a multivariate approach. The inability to estimate the probability of non-target escapes without fine-scale hook condition information, illustrated very well in the fits that do not include the stratified dataset, demonstrates this impact very well. This underlines the importance of having a reliable estimate of the abundance of these non-target species, as getting it wrong will seriously impact the view of halibut population levels. While it is very likely that removing this parameter completely when fitting the model to data that can't estimate reliably would improve the fit, we thought that keeping it demonstrated this point very well and was therefore retained for the analysis.

A key outcome from this analysis is that there is evidence that, while the fixed stations were likely appropriate to capture the changes over time of halibut abundance, they probably missed changes in distribution and abundance of the non-target species. As these encorporate a great number of other species (e.g., cod, dogfish, etc.), it is not too surprising that their overall joint spatial distribution would shift which, as we have shown, would then have an impact on the halibut catch rates. The timing of the stratified random sampling design implementation therefore appears to be fortunate, as it started right when the fixed stations would have failed to capture the changes in non-target species. This new design does appear to correct for this failure in the model output, although the impact of the fixed stations on these years is unclear but would hopefully be diluted by the greater number of stratified random stations. Furthermore, the estimates from the stratified random design will only get more accurate and precise as years are added into the time series.

While it was developed for this specific fishery, this model could easily be applied to any longline fisheries across the world and promises to improve indices of abundance used for stock assessment models. Depending on the fishery, it could be of great value to further modify the multinomial equation used by our approach to expand on the non-target species to include multiple specific species. More specifically, if there are a finite amount of other species being caught aside from the target, it would likely lead to improvements in estimated catch rates for the target species.
