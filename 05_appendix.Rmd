Statistical innovations for obtaining and validating Atlantic halibut longline survey indices of exploitable biomass through implementation of a multinomial, hook occupancy model.

**Estimated Value**

The total value of any contract(s) emanating from this TOR is $10000 (4 months).

**Objectives of the Requirement**

To extend the proposed spatial modeling to include the fix station and explore spatial temporal model to provide an index over time from the beginning of the survey until current time.

**Background, Assumptions and Specific Scope of the Requirement**

Together, the Atlantic Halibut Council and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) have used an annual longline survey to monitor Atlantic halibut exploitable biomass since 1988. The survey was originally stratified into areas of Low, Medium and High catch based on data from commercial fishing logs (1995-1997). Stratified estimates were used until the assessment by Trzcinski et al. (2009) when the stratification system was no longer utilized (although the strata were still part of the survey design). Starting in 2009, a standardized catch rate calculated from a negative binomial (NB) generalized linear model (GLM) replaced the stratified estimate of mean weight per standard longline set (den Heyer et. al., 2013).

The simple stratified mean adjusted catch rate and the NB GLM both assume that halibut are the only species being caught by the longline hooks with no accounting for other species competing for hooks. In addition, these methods implicitly assume that all hooks that do not have halibut would still have been able to catch halibut had there been more of these fish in the area. However, some number of hooks will be occupied by species other than halibut and other hooks will be empty with bait still attached or missing. Smith (2016) recently recommended replacing the NB GLM with a multinomial model that accounted for both the number of halibut caught, and the number of hooks occupied by other species or missing bait.

The Atlantic halibut longline survey was designed to provide an annual index of abundance (numbers or weights) to monitor the status of the stock for management purposes. Based on the work has been done by now, it is useful to extend that spatial modeling to include the fix station as well, also explore spatial temporal model to provide an index over time from the beginning of the survey until current time. In other words, we will have one index to include in our assessment model for the longline survey data both from fixed station and stratified random.

**Tasks, Activities and Deliverables**

The deliverables for the project will be to:

1) Develop spatiotemporal multinomial model for stratified random station survey 2017-2020

2) Develop spatiotemporal multinomial model for the fixed station survey data 1998-2020 (app 230 station 1998-2016 and 100 stations 2017-2020)

3) Develop a spatiotemporal model that simultaneously analyzes the data from the four years, 2017-2020, for which there are both fixed and stratified random station data.

4) Develop a spatiotemporal model for the entire time series, 1998-2020, of fixed station and random survey data

5) A technical report.

**Expected Start and Completion Dates**

All work will be completed between September 2021 and January 2022. The weekly number of hours worked will vary over that timeframe, as agreed upon between DFO and Dalhousie University (Dr. Joanna Mills Flemming).

**Contingencies**

If the tasks/deliverables are in jeopardy due to unforeseen circumstances such as student leaving the project or because of other complications or poor work quality, the Scientific Authorities will proceed with the project goals through contracts to other students and/or conduct the analyses themselves.

**Reporting Requirements**

1. Basic updates from the student on how work is progressing are required weekly by email or phone with the Scientific Authorities.

2. At the end of work, a detailed report, relating the progress of the project with respect to the identified deliverables, will be provided to the Project Authorities. This report must be sufficiently detailed that the Project Authorities are able to evaluate whether the progress of the project is sufficient that contingency plans, as outlined above, do not need to be implemented.

**Change Management Procedures**

Changes to the scope of the project will be made through agreement by all parties and documented through email correspondence.
