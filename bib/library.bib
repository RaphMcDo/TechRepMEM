abstract = {Laboratory experiments were conducted to study the effects of food concentration, turbulence and turbidity on growth and survival of striped bass larvae Morone saxatilis . Initial experiments indicated that striped bass larvae could forage and grow well at food concentrations ranging from 50 to 250 ind/l of the copepod Eurytemora affinis and that growth was similar on Artemia sp. and E. affinis . Subsequent experiments tested effects of turbidity (50, 100, 150 ppm kaolin), reduced light intensity (2000, 1000, 600, 300 lux) and turbulence, separately, and then reduced light intensity (450, 70, 12, 0.4 lux) in combination with turbidity (150 ppm kaolin) and turbulence to determine how these variables moderate food requirements of striped bass larvae. Reducing light or adding turbulence reduced growth and forage rates, while adding turbidity in combination with turbulence apparently ameliorated some of the negative effects of the turbulence},

abstract = {Characterizing the nature of genetic differentiation among individuals and populations and its distribution across the genome is increasingly important to inform both conservation and management of exploited species. Atlantic Halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) is an ecologically and commercially important fish species, yet knowledge of population structure and genomic diversity in this species remains lacking. Here, we use restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and a chromosome-level genome assembly to identify over 86 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms mapped to 24 chromosome-sized scaffolds, genotyped in 734 individuals across the Northwest Atlantic. We describe subtle but significant genome-wide regional structuring between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and adjacent Atlantic continental shelf. However, the majority of genetic divergence is associated with a large putative chromosomal rearrangement (5.74 megabases) displaying high differentiation and linkage disequilibrium, but no evidence of geographic variation. Demographic reconstructions suggest periods of expansion coinciding with glacial retreat, and more recent declines in Ne. This work highlights the utility of genomic data to identify multiple sources of genetic structure and genomic diversity in commercially exploited marine species.},

abstract = {Darwin insisted that evolutionary change occurs very slowly over long periods of time, and this gradualist view was accepted by his supporters and incorporated into the infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics developed by R. A. Fisher and others. It dominated the first century of evolutionary biology, but has been challenged in more recent years both by field surveys demonstrating strong selection in natural populations and by quantitative trait loci and genomic studies, indicating that adaptation is often attributable to mutations in a few genes. The prevalence of strong selection seems inconsistent, however, with the high heritability often observed in natural populations, and with the claim that the amount of morphological change in contemporary and fossil lineages is independent of elapsed time. I argue that these discrepancies are resolved by realistic accounts of environmental and evolutionary changes. First, the physical and biotic environment varies on all time-scales, leading to an indefinite increase in environmental variance over time. Secondly, the intensity and direction of natural selection are also likely to fluctuate over time, leading to an indefinite increase in phenotypic variance in any given evolving lineage. Finally, detailed long-term studies of selection in natural populations demonstrate that selection often changes in direction. I conclude that the traditional gradualist scheme of weak selection acting on polygenic variation should be supplemented by the view that adaptation is often based on oligogenic variation exposed to commonplace, strong, fluctuating natural selection.},

abstract = {A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) that treats year and spatial cell as fixed effects while treating vessel as a random effect is used to examine fishing power among chartered industry-based vessels and a research trawler, the FRV Miller Freeman, for bottom trawl surveys on the upper continental slope of U.S. West coast. A Bernoulli distribution is used to model the probability of a non-zero haul and the gamma distribution to model the non-zero catch rates of four groundfish species. The use of vessel as a random effect allows the data for the various vessels to be combined and a single continuous time-series of biomass indices to be developed for stock assessment purposes. The GLMMs fit the data reasonably well. Among the different models examined, the GLMM incorporating a random vessel × year effect had the smallest $\Delta$AIC and was thus chosen as the best model. Also, estimated random effects coefficients associated with the industry-based vessels and the FRV Miller Freeman for each year suggests that these vessels can be assumed to be from a common random effects distribution. These results suggest that combining data from the chartered industry-based vessels and from the research trawler may be appropriate to develop indices of abundance for stock assessment purposes. Finally, an evaluation of variances associated with abundance indices from the different models indicate that analyzing these data as a fixed effect GLM may underestimate the level of variability due to ignoring the grouped nature of tows within vessels. As such, use of a mixed model approach with vessel as a random effect is a reasonable approach to developing abundance indices and their variances. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) is an iteroparous anadromous species that spawns dispersive offspring into freshwater habitats and exhibits a high fecundity and high embryo and larval mortality rates. Field studies indicate that temperature differentially affects spawning behaviour and larval survival, and periods of high egg production are often mis-timed for optimal larval survival. I hypothesize that age structure of females may be an important determinant in reducing variability in recruitment through its influence on spawning behaviour. Age diversity of Chesapeake Bay female striped bass is indexed according to expectations of age-specific reproductive values in an unexploited population. The age diversity index was positively correlated to spawning dispersion (egg presence ratio) and 0+ juvenile abundance during the recent period of population recovery (1985–1995). Diversity in age structure and spawning behaviour may contribute to a storage effect, because in most years minority behaviours would result in sustained recruitment. A diverse age structure may thus contribute to an accumulation of spawning stock biomass and increase the future likelihood of dominant year classes.},

abstract = {A reliable measure of gear capture efficiency is required to calculate unbiased estimates of population size and fishing mortality from survey data in a stock assessment. However, capture efficiency can vary spatially and temporally due to changes in abundance, stock area, the environment, and the sampling gear itself. Therefore, periodic reassessment of this parameter is necessary to ensure that the catchability coefficients being applied accurately reflect the capture efficiency of the survey sampling gear, especially when catchability is being estimated outside of the stock assessment model. Using data from field experiments conducted in 1999, 2000, 2003, and 2013, we evaluated spatial and temporal variability in capture efficiency for a commercial dredge used to conduct a fishery-independent survey of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) population in Delaware Bay, USA. A spatial gradient in capture efficiency was detected, but no temporal trend. Capture efficiency was a function of the density of oysters in the sampled area. To our knowledge this is the first time density-dependent capture efficiency has been identified for a sessile invertebrate stock survey. Since density dependence in capture efficiency leads to hyperstable catch-per-unit-effort, caution is advised when deriving oyster abundance from dredge survey catch-per-effort data, especially at low oyster density and when high spatial resolution estimates of survey dredge capture efficiency are not available.},

abstract = {The precarious state of many nearshore marine ecosystems has prompted the use of marine protected areas as a tool for management and conservation. However, there remains substantial debate over their design and, in particular, how to best account for the spatial dynamics of nearshore marine species. Many commercially important nearshore marine species are sedentary as adults, with limited home ranges. It is as larvae that they disperse greater distances, traveling with ocean currents sometimes hundreds of kilometers. As a result, these species exist in spatially complex systems of connected subpopulations. Here, we explicitly account for the mutual dependence of subpopulations and approach protected area design in terms of network robustness. Our goal is to characterize the topology of nearshore metapopulation networks and their response to perturbation, and to identify critical subpopulations whose protection would reduce the risk for stock collapse. We define metapopulation networks using realistic estimates of larval dispersal generated from ocean circulation simulations and spatially explicit metapopulation models, and we then explore their robustness using node-removal simulation experiments. Nearshore metapopulations show small-world network properties, and we identify a set of highly connected hub subpopulations whose removal maximally disrupts the metapopulation network. Protecting these subpopulations reduces the risk for systemic failure and stock collapse. Our focus on catastrophe avoidance provides a unique perspective for spatial marine planning and the design of marine protected areas.},

abstract = {Gaussian likelihood inference has been studied and used extensively in both statistical theory and applications due to its simplicity. However, in practice, the assumption of Gaussianity is rarely met in the analysis of spatial data. In this paper, we study the effect of non-Gaussianity on Gaussian likelihood inference for the parameters of the Mat{\'{e}}rn covariance model. By using Monte Carlo simulations, we generate spatial data from a Tukey g-and-h random field, a flexible trans-Gaussian random field, with the Mat{\'{e}}rn covariance function, where g controls skewness and h controls tail heaviness. We use maximum likelihood based on the multivariate Gaussian distribution to estimate the parameters of the Mat{\'{e}}rn covariance function. We illustrate the effects of non-Gaussianity of the data on the estimated covariance function by means of functional boxplots. Thanks to our tailored simulation design, a comparison of the maximum likelihood estimator under both the increasing and fixed domain asymptotics for spatial data is performed. We find that the maximum likelihood estimator based on Gaussian likelihood is overall satisfying and preferable than the non-distribution-based weighted least squares estimator for data from the Tukey g-and-h random field. We also present the result for Gaussian kriging based on Mat{\'{e}}rn covariance estimates with data from the Tukey g-and-h random field and observe an overall satisfactory performance.},

abstract = {To investigate the connectivity between central California marine protected areas (MPAs), back-projections were calculated using the network of high-frequency (HF) radar ocean surface current mapping stations operated along the California coast by the member institutions of the Coastal Ocean Currents Monitoring Program with funding provided by California voters through Propositions 40 {\&} 50 and administered by the State Coastal Conservancy. Trajectories of 1 km resolution grids of water particles were back-projected from ten MPAs each hour, out through 40 days in the past, from each day in 2008, producing a map of where surface waters travel over a 40-day period to reach the MPAs – and visualizations of the length of time the waters travel along these paths. By comparing the travel times of those back-projected track-points that crossed between MPA regions, the connection time between MPAs along the State's central coast was assessed. Repeating these calculations resulted in a connectivity matrix between the MPAs in the region, and may be useful for assessing connectivity for the important invertebrate and fish larvae that are restricted to the surface ocean during a fraction of their lifecycle.},

abstract = {Deep-sea stony corals, which can be fragile, long-lived, late to mature
and habitat-forming, are defined as vulnerable marine ecosystem
indicator taxa. Under United Nations resolutions, these corals require
protection from human disturbance such as fishing. To better understand
the vulnerability of stony corals (Goniocorella dumosa, Madrepora
oculata, Solenosmilia variabilis) to disturbance within the New Zealand
region and to guide marine protected area design, genetic structure and
connectivity were determined using microsatellite loci and DNA
sequencing. Analyses compared population genetic differentiation between
two biogeographic provinces, amongst three subregions
(north-central-south) and amongst geomorphic features. Extensive
population genetic differentiation was revealed by microsatellite
variation, whilst DNA sequencing revealed very little differentiation.
For G. dumosa, genetic differentiation existed amongst regions and
geomorphic features, but not between provinces. For M. oculata, only a
north-central-south regional structure was observed. For S. variabilis,
genetic differentiation was observed between provinces, amongst regions
and amongst geomorphic features. Populations on the Kermadec Ridge were
genetically different from Chatham Rise populations for all three
species. A significant isolation-by-depth pattern was observed for both
marker types in G. dumosa and also in ITS of M. oculata. An
isolation-by-distance pattern was revealed for microsatellite variation
in S. variabilis. Medium to high levels of self-recruitment were
detected in all geomorphic populations, and rates and routes of genetic
connectivity were species-specific. These patterns of population genetic
structure and connectivity at a range of spatial scales indicate that
flexible spatial management approaches are required for the conservation
of deep-sea corals around New Zealand.},

abstract = {Common uncertainties in stock assessment relate to parameters or assumptions that strongly determine both the estimates of quantities of management interest (e.g. stock depletion) and related reference points (e.g. biomass at maximum sustainable yield). The risks associated with these uncertainties are often presented to managers in the form of decision tables. However, a formal evaluation of the risks from misspecifying an assessment model over time-horizons spanning multiple assessment cycles requires closed-loop simulation. There were two aims of this study: (a) develop an approach to identify and evaluate asymmetries in risk to yields and spawning biomass due to biases in key parameters and data sources in a stock assessment model, (b) quantify the relative importance of correctly specifying the various assessment attributes. A computationally efficient stock reduction analysis was evaluated using closed-loop simulation to identify risks associated with a stock assessment with persistent positive and negative biases in the key parameters and inaccurate assumptions regarding data sources. Six types of assessment misspecification were examined, namely the assumed natural mortality rate, the assumed recruitment compensation ratio, the assumed age of maturity, a hyper-stable or hyper-deplete index of abundance, over- or under-reporting of historical catch, and misspecification of the assumed shape of the selectivity curve. This study reveals large asymmetries in risk associated with common uncertainties in stock assessment processes. We highlight the value of reproducible and computationally efficient stock assessment models that can be investigated by closed-loop simulation before being used for fisheries management.},

Drawn to their shiny domed shells and spiked tails, I could not resist picking them up, turning them over and watching the wondrous mechanical movement of their glistening legs, articulating with one another as smoothly as the inner working of a clock. What was it like to be a horseshoe crab, I wondered? What did they eat? Did they always move around together? Why were some so large and others much smaller? How old were they, anyway? What must it feel like to live underwater? What else was out there, down there, in the cool, green depths that gave rise to such intriguing creatures? The only way to find out, I reasoned, would be to go into the ocean and see for myself, and so I did, and more than 60 years later, I still do.},

abstract = {Fisheries scientists use biological models to determine sustainable fishing rates and forecast future dynamics. These models require both life-history parameters (mortality, maturity, growth) and stock-recruit parameters (juvenile production). However, there has been little research to simultaneously predict life-history and stock-recruit parameters. I develop the first data-integrated life-history model, which extends a simple model of evolutionary dynamics to field measurements of life-history parameters as well as historical records of spawning output and subsequent recruitment. This evolutionary model predicts recruitment productivity (steepness) and variability (variance and autocorrelation in recruitment deviations) as well as mortality, maturity, growth, and size, and uses these to predict intrinsic growth rate (r) for all described fishes. The model confirms previous analysis showing little correlation between steepness and either natural mortality or asymptotic maximum size ((Formula presented.)). However, it does reveal taxonomic patterns, where family Sebastidae has lower steepness ((Formula presented.)) and Salmonidae has elevated steepness ((Formula presented.)) relative to the prediction for bony fishes (class Actinopterygii, (Formula presented.)). Similarly, genus Sebastes has growth rate (Formula presented.) (0.09) approaching that of several shark families (Lamniformes: 0.02; Carcharhiniformes: 0.02). A cross-validation experiment confirms that the model is accurate, explains a substantial portion of variance (32{\%}–67{\%}), but generates standard errors that are somewhat too small. Predictive intervals are tighter for species than for higher-level organizations (e.g. families), and predictions (including intervals) are available for all fishes worldwide in R package FishLife. I conclude by outlining how multivariate predictions of life-history and stock-recruit parameters could be useful for stock assessment, decision theory, ensemble modelling and strategic management.},

The historical review traces the developments of the respective concepts. The meta-analysis explores 3929 weight–length relationships of the typeW ¼ aLb for 1773 species of fishes. It shows that 82{\%} of the variance in a plot of log a over b can be explained by allometric versus isometric growth patterns and by different body shapes of the respective species. Across species median b ¼ 3.03 is significantly larger than 3.0, thus indicating a tendency towards slightly positive-allometric growth (increase in relative body thickness or plumpness) in most fishes. The expected range of 2.5 {\textless} b {\textless} 3.5 is confirmed. Mean estimates of b outside this range are often based on only one or two weight–length relationships per species. However, true cases of strong allometric growth do exist and three examples are given. Within species, a plot of log a vs b can be used to detect outliers in weight–length relationships. An equation to calcu- late mean condition factors from weight–length relationships is given as Kmean ¼ 100aLb)3. Relative weight Wrm ¼ 100W/ (amLbm ) can be used for comparing the condition of individuals across populations, where am is the geometric mean of a and bm is the mean of b across all available weight–length relationships for a given species.

We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to determine how biological reference points differ among common population structures and to investigate the performance of management quantities that were calculated assuming incorrect spatial population dynamics. Simulated reference points were compared across a range of population structures and connectivity scenarios demonstrating the influence of spatial assumptions on management benchmarks. Simulations also illustrated that applying a harvest level based on misdiagnosed spatial structure leads to biased stock status indicators, overharvesting, or foregone yield. Across the scenarios examined, incorrectly specifying the connectivity dynamics (particularly misdiagnosing source-sink dynamics) was often more detrimental than ignoring spatial structure altogether. However, when the true dynamics exhibited spatial structure, incorrectly assuming panmictic structure resulted in severe depletion if harvesting concentrated on more productive population units (instead of being homogeneously distributed). Incorporating spatially generalized operating models, such as the one developed here, into management strategy evaluations will help develop management procedures that are more robust to spatial complexities.},

abstract = {Aim: Isolation by distance (IBD) analyses are an effective tool for determining genetic connectivity among populations, providing a basis for estimating dispersal and thus contributing to spatial biodiversity planning. Here, we use an IBD approach to determine patterns of connectivity to infer dispersal distances for a phylogenetically diverse range of marine species. Location: Two thousand and eight hundred kilometre of South African coastline. Methods: mtDNA data sets for 11 rocky shore and reef-dwelling marine species with diverse life history strategies (broadcast spawning, brooding and live-bearing) were used to quantify intraspecific genetic connectivity by means of global and pairwise $\Phi$st. Mantel tests were used to assess the significance of genetic structure with geographic distance. Significant, positive slopes were used to estimate dispersal distances. For all species, we also plotted genetic diversity along the coast and compared this to patterns of species richness. Results: For seven of the 11 species tested, we report positive IBD relationships, with patterns of IBD of similar magnitude in broadcast spawners and live-bearers. Dispersal estimates were low, with effective distances of {\textless} 10 km per generation. We find discordance between pelagic larval development and population structure and that genetic structure and the physio-geographic features of the coastline considered to be important biogeographic barriers do not overlap. Genetic diversity and species richness show congruent patterns, with both variables lowest on the west coast, and increasing towards the east. Main conclusions: Our study highlights the complexity of marine systems and the clear need for regional assessments of connectivity, rather than more general management plans which may not otherwise effectively encompass area-specific conservation needs. Importantly, we show that the current marine protected area (MPA) network in South Africa is not effective in protecting evolutionary processes and strongly recommend a network of more closely spaced MPAs in the region that reflects the low average connectivity between distant marine populations.},

abstract = {In fisheries ecology and stock assessment, recruitment signifies the transition from early stages of the life cycle which are characterized by environmentally-driven variability and density-dependence in mortality rates, to a recruited phase when natural mortality is largely stable and density-independent. Age or size at recruitment is an important structural element of age-structured fisheries models and stock assessment methods, yet the choice is often somewhat arbitrary and little guidance exists for when, biologically, a fish can be considered recruited. Such models may be mis-specified when recruitment is assumed to occur too early, i.e. when ‘recruited' fish are still subject to density-dependent mortality even though the model specifies that they are not. We synthesize empirical data on density-dependence in mortality at different life stages within wild, stocked, cultured and experimentally manipulated fish populations. Results suggest the existence of a broad, approximately invariant pattern of density dependence across a wide range of fish life histories. Density-dependent mortality is most likely to occur, and potentially strongest, while fish are smaller than 10{\%} of population asymptotic lengthy L∞. Both the likelihood of encountering density-dependent mortality and its potential strength are far more moderate for fish between 10 and 20{\%} of L∞, and diminish in fish larger than 20{\%} of L∞. This result provides the first empirically-based guidance for determining an appropriate size or age at recruitment for stock assessments. The result also provides information relevant to other fisheries management issues, such as the design and evaluation of fish stocking programs.},

ABSTRACT Modifications in shell structure, mantle, and adductor muscle are considered derived adaptations that allowed scallops to swim. This suggests that morphological properties of the adductor muscle and shell should relate to swimming performance in scallops. Various morphological characteristics of the shell (mass, aspect ratio, and volume between the valves) and the adductor muscle (size, position, and attachment to the shell) were measured in six scallop species (Amusium balloti, Placopecten magellanicus, Equichlamys bifrons, Pecten fumatus, Mimachlamys asperrima, and Crassadoma gigantea) with distinct swimming strategies, as documented by measurements of muscle use during induced escape responses. Morphological characteristics of the shell and adductor muscle differed markedly between the species, but did not always follow their swimming strategies. Principal components analysis revealed that shell width, shell and muscle masses, and associated morphological attributes were closely linked with swimming endurance. The intensity of the escape response was best predicted by the aspect ratio and the obliqueness of the adductor muscle.},

Since different types of errors propagate through these processes, it can be difficult to identify a particular family of distributions for modelling errors on observations a priori. By implementing several observational likelihoods, modelling both numbers- and proportions-at-age, in an age-based state-space stock assessment model, we compare the model fit for each choice of likelihood along with the implications for spawning stock biomass and mean fishing mortality. We propose using AIC intervals based on fitting the full observational model for comparing different observational likelihoods. Using data from four stocks, we show that the model fit is improved by modelling the correlation of observations within years. However, the best choice of observational likelihood differs for different stocks, and the choice is important for the short-term conclusions drawn from the assessment model; in particular, the choice can influence total allowable catch advise based on reference points.},

abstract = {Many statistical models in ecology follow the state space paradigm. For such models, the important step of model validation rarely receives as much attention as estimation or hypothesis testing, perhaps due to lack of available algorithms and software. Model validation is often based on a naive adaptation of Pearson residuals, i.e. the difference between observations and posterior means, even if this approach is flawed. Here, we consider validation of state space models through one-step prediction errors, and discuss principles and practicalities arising when the model has been fitted with a tool for estimation in general mixed effects models. Implementing one-step predictions in the R package Template Model Builder, we demonstrate that it is possible to perform model validation with little effort, even if the ecological model is multivariate, has non-linear dynamics, and whether observations are continuous or discrete. With both simulated data, and a real data set related to geolocation of seals, we demonstrate both the potential and the limitations of the techniques. Our results fill a need for convenient methods for validating a state space model, or alternatively, rejecting it while indicating useful directions in which the model could be improved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Aim: A detailed understanding of spatial genetic structure (SGS) and the factors driving contemporary patterns of gene flow and genetic diversity are fundamental for developing conservation and management plans for marine fisheries. We performed a detailed study of SGS and genetic diversity throughout the overharvested queen conch (Lobatus gigas) fishery. Caribbean countries were presented as major populations to examine transboundary patterns of population differentiation. Location: Nineteen locations in the greater Caribbean from Anguilla, the Bahamas, Belize, Caribbean Netherlands, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Turks and Caicos, and the USA. Methods: We genotyped 643 individuals with nine microsatellites. Population genetic and multivariate analyses characterized SGS. We tested the alternate hypotheses: (1) SGS is randomly distributed in space or (2) pairwise genetic structure among sites is correlated with oceanic distance (IBOD). Results: Our study found that L. gigas does not form a single panmictic population in the greater Caribbean. Significant levels of genetic differentiation were identified between Caribbean countries (F CT = 0.011; p = .0001), within Caribbean countries (F SC = 0.003; p = .001), and among sites irrespective of geographic location (F ST = 0.013; p = .0001). Gene flow across the greater Caribbean was constrained by oceanic distance (p = .0009; Mantel r = .40), which acted to isolate local populations. Main conclusions: Gene flow over the spatial scale of the entire Caribbean basin is constrained by oceanic distance, which may impede the natural recovery of overfished L. gigas populations. Our results suggest a careful blend of local and international management will be required to ensure long-term sustainability for the species.},

abstract = {No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are successful in protecting populations of many exploited fish species, but it is often unclear whether networks of MPAs are adequately spaced to ensure connectivity among reserves, and whether there is spillover into adjacent exploited areas. Such issues are particularly important in species with low dispersal potential, many of which exist as genetically distinct regional stocks. The roman, Chrysoblephus laticeps, is an overexploited, commercially important sparid endemic to South Africa. Post-recruits display resident behavior and occupy small home ranges, making C. laticeps a suitable model species to study genetic structure in marine teleosts with potentially low dispersal ability. We used multilocus data from two types of highly variable genetic markers (mitochondrial DNA control region and seven microsatellite markers) to clarify patterns of genetic connectivity and population structure in C. laticeps using samples from two MPAs and several moderately or severely exploited regions. Despite using analytical tools that are sensitive to detect even subtle genetic structure, we found that this species exists as a single, well-mixed stock throughout its core distribution. The high levels of connectivity identified among sites support the findings of previous studies that have indicated that inshore MPAs are an adequate tool for managing overexploited temperate reef fishes. Even though dispersal of adult C. laticeps out of MPAs is limited, the fact that the large adults in these reserves produce exponentially more offspring than their smaller counterparts in exploited areas makes MPAs a rich source of recruits. We nonetheless caution against concluding that the lack of structure identified in C. laticeps and several other southern African teleosts can be considered to be representative of marine teleosts in this region in general. Many such species are represented in more than one marine biogeographic province and may be comprised of regionally adapted stocks that require individual management.},

Plates counts were performed aerobically and anaerobically at 35, 22 and 7°C; randomly-selected isolates (n=1742) from the aerobic plate counts were identified using MIDI and BIOLOG systems. Enrichments and selective plating were used to detect foodborne pathogens. A mixed model analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences (P{\textless}0.05) among plate counts; data for the S, G, I and W were analysed separately. Aquaculture system had no significant effect on any of the plate counts for the S, G, I or W. Aerobic plate counts were significantly higher than anaerobic counts at the same incubation temperature for the S, G and W, but for the I, aerobic and anaerobic counts were not significantly different. Under the same incubation atmosphere, counts at 35 and 22°C were not significantly different from each other, but counts at both temperatures were significantly higher than counts at 7°C.

abstract = {As the science of connectivity evolves, so too must the management of coral reefs. It is now clear that the spatial scale of disturbances to coral reef ecosystems is larger and the scale of larval connectivity is smaller than previously thought. This poses a challenge to the current focus of coral reef management, which often centers on the establishment of no-take reserves (NTRs) that in practice are often too small, scattered, or have low stakeholder compliance. Fished species are generally larger and more abundant in protected reserves, where their reproductive potential is often greater, yet documented demographic benefits of these reproductive gains outside reserves are modest at best. Small reproductive populations and limited dispersal of larvae play a role, as does the diminished receptivity to settling larvae of degraded habitats that can limit recruitment by more than 50{\%}. For ‘‘demographic connectivity'' to contribute to the resilience of coral reefs, it must function beyond the box of no-take reserves. Spe- cifically, it must improve nursery habitats on or near reefs and enhance the reproductive output of ecologically important species throughout coral reef ecosystems. Spe- cial protection of ecologically important species (e.g., some herbivores in the Caribbean) and size-regulated fisheries that capitalize on the benefits of NTRs and maintain critical ecological functions are examples of measures that coalesce marine reserve effects and improve the resilience of coral reef ecosystems. Important too is the necessity of local involvement in the management process so that social costs and benefits are properly assessed, compliance increased and success stories accrued},

abstract = {Managing fisheries resources to maintain healthy ecosystems is one of the main goals of the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF). While a number of international treaties call for the implementation of EAF, there are still gaps in the underlying methodology. One aspect that has received substantial scientific attention recently is fisheries-induced evolution (FIE). Increasing evidence indicates that intensive fishing has the potential to exert strong directional selection on life-history traits, behaviour, physiology, and morphology of exploited fish. Of particular concern is that reversing evolutionary responses to fishing can be much more difficult than reversing demographic or phenotypically plastic responses. Furthermore, like climate change, multiple agents cause FIE, with effects accumulating over time. Consequently, FIE may alter the utility derived from fish stocks, which in turn can modify the monetary value living aquatic resources provide to society. Quantifying and predicting the evolutionary effects of fishing is therefore important for both ecological and economic reasons. An important reason this is not happening is the lack of an appropriate assessment framework. We therefore describe the evolutionary impact assessment (EvoIA) as a structured approach for assessing the evolutionary consequences of fishing and evaluating the predicted evolutionary outcomes of alternative management options. EvoIA can contribute to EAF by clarifying how evolution may alter stock properties and ecological relations, support the precautionary approach to fisheries management by addressing a previously overlooked source of uncertainty and risk, and thus contribute to sustainable fisheries. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

One moment saw concern for the Mi'kmaq's welfare increase and the focus of that concern become fixed on "civilizing" through assimilation. Another was a growing scientific curiosity expressed through the founding of intellectual organizations such the Nova Scotian Institute of Science, and often at odds with prevailing religious beliefs, which adhered to the "sacred chronology" of the Bible. These moments converged in the addresses on cultural history made by members of the Nova Scotian Institute of Science between 1864 and 1912. The interpretations offered by the institute's members demonstrate an increasing separation of the contemporary Mi'kmaq from the precontact past of the province, thus constructing a chronology that-if not biblically sacred- was sacrosanct to the narrative of progress that underlay the settler project in Nova Scotia.},

abstract = {Spatial erosion of stock structure through local overfishing can lead to stock collapse because fish often prefer certain locations, and fisheries tend to focus on those locations. Fishery managers are challenged to maintain the integrity of the entire stock and require scientific approaches that provide them with sound advice. Here we propose a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal modelling framework for fish abundance data to estimate key parameters that define spatial stock structure: persistence (similarity of spatial structure over time), connectivity (coherence of temporal pattern over space), and spatial variance (variation across the seascape). The consideration of these spatial parameters in the stock assessment process can help identify the erosion of structure and assist in preventing local overfishing. We use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in eastern Canada as a case study an examine the behaviour of these parameters from the height of the fishery through its collapse. We identify clear signals in parameter behaviour under circumstances of destructive stock erosion as well as for recovery of spatial structure even when combined with a non-recovery in abundance. Further, our model reveals the spatial pattern of areas of high and low density persists over the 41 years of available data and identifies the remnant patches. Models of this sort are crucial to recovery plans if we are to identify and protect remaining sources of recolonization for Atlantic cod. Our method is immediately applicable to other exploited species.},

abstract = {Limited conservation resources mean that management decisions are often made on the basis of scarce biological information. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed as a way to improve the representation of biodiversity features in conservation planning, but the extent to which SDMs are used in conservation planning is unclear. We reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey conservation planning literature to explore if and how SDMs are used in conservation prioritisations. We use text mining to analyse 641 peer-reviewed conservation prioritisation articles published between 2006 and 2012 and find that only 10{\%} of articles specifically mention SDMs in the abstract, title, and/or keywords. We use topic modelling of all peer-reviewed articles plus a detailed review of a random sample of 40 peer-reviewed and grey literature plans to evaluate factors that might influence whether decision-makers use SDMs to inform prioritisations. Our results reveal that habitat maps, expert-elicited species distributions, or metrics representing landscape processes (e.g. connectivity surfaces) are used more often than SDMs as biodiversity surrogates in prioritisations. We find four main reasons for using such alternatives in place of SDMs: (i) insufficient species occurrence data (particularly for threatened species); (ii) lack of biologically-meaningful predictor data relevant to the spatial scale of planning; (iii) low concern about uncertainty in biodiversity data; and (iv) a focus on accounting for ecological, evolutionary, and cumulative threatening processes that requires alternative data to be collected. Our results suggest that SDMs are perceived as best-suited to dealing with traditional reserve selection objectives and accounting for uncertainties such as future climate change or mapping accuracy. The majority of planners in both the grey and peer-reviewed literature appear to trade off the benefits of using SDMs for the benefits of including information on multiple threats and processes. We suggest that increasing the complexity of species distribution modelling methods might have little impact on their use in conservation planning without a corresponding increase in research aiming at better incorporation of a range of ecological, evolutionary, and threatening processes.},

abstract = {Survival of larval fish is often linked to production of preferred prey such as copepods, both inter- and intra-annually. In turn, copepod production depends not only the quantity of food, but also on the nutritional quality, edibility and/or toxicity of their micro-algal food. Hence, larval fish survival can become de-coupled from levels of nutrient input depending on the resulting composition of the plankton. Here we use a plankton dynamics model to study nutrient input, phytoplankton composition and copepod, Paracalanus, production in relation to interannual variation in recruitment of snapper, Chrysophrys auratus, in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The model was able to simulate the ratio of diatoms to flagellates in the plume of the main river entering Port Phillip Bay. Interannual variability in the copepod, Paracalanus, abundance during the C. auratus spawning period over 5 years was accurately predicted. The seasonal peak in Paracalanus production depended on the timing and magnitude (match-mismatch) of nutrient inputs and how these were reflected in temporal change in the diatom:flagellate ratio. In turn, the model-predicted Paracalanus abundance was strongly related to inter-annaul variability in abundance of snapper, C. auratus, larvae over 7 years. Years of highest larval C. auratus abundance coincided with a matching of the spawning period with the peak in Paracalanus abundance. High freshwater flows and nutrient inputs led to an early seasonal dominance of diatoms, and consequently reduced abundances of copepods over the C. auratus spawning period with correspondingly low abundances of larvae. Conversely years of very low rainfall and nutrient input also led to low phytoplankton and copepod concentrations and larval C. auratus abundances. Highest abundances of larval C. auratus occurred in years of low to intermediate rainfall and nutrient inputs, particularly when pulses of nutrients occurred in the spring period, the latter supporting the match-mismatch hypothesis.},

These methods are based on fitting generalized linear models to catch and effort data for several regions in this fishery. This is to take account of the multi-gear nature of the fishery and the spatial structure of the trends in catch rate. The data on whether or not the catch rate is zero and the catch rate given that it is non-zero are analysed separately and then combined to provide indices of abundance. The former analysis is based on assuming the data are Bernoulli random variables. Given the uncertainty about the appropriate error-model to assume when fitting generalized linear models to catch and effort data, four alternative error-models - log-normal, log-gamma, Poisson, and negative binomial were explored when modelling the non-zero catch rates.

abstract = {The distribution of effect sizes of genes underlying adaptation is unknown (Orr 2005). Are suites of traits that diverged under natural selection controlled by a few pleiotropic genes of large effect (major genes model), by many independently acting genes of small effect (infinitesimal model), or by a combination, with frequency inversely related to effect size (geometric model)? To address this we carried out a quantitative trait loci (QTL) study of a suite of 54 position traits describing body shapes of two threespine stickleback species: an ancestral Pacific marine form and a highly derived benthic species inhabiting a geologically young lake. About half of the 26 detected QTL affected just one coordinate and had small net effects, but several genomic regions affected multiple aspects of shape and had large net effects. The distribution of effect sizes followed the gamma distribution, as predicted by the geometric model of adaptation when detection limits are taken into account. The sex-determining chromosome region had the largest effect of any QTL. Ancestral sexual dimorphism was similar to the direction of divergence, and was largely eliminated during freshwater adaptation, suggesting that sex differences may provide variation upon which selection can act. Several shape QTL are linked to Eda, a major gene responsible for reduction of lateral body armor in freshwater. Our results are consistent with predictions of the geometric model of adaptation. Shape evolution in stickleback results from a few genes with large and possibly widespread effects and multiple genes of smaller effect.},

The model used assumes that occurrence of bycatch can be described as a log-linear combination of covariates and random effects modeled as Gaussian fields. Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) is used for fast calculations. The method introduced is general, and is applied on bycatch of juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) in the Barents Sea shrimp (Pandalus borealis) fishery. In this fishery we compare our prediction method with the well known ratio and effort methods, and make a strong case that the Bayesian spatio-temporal method produces more reliable historical bycatch predictions compared to existing methods.},

abstract = {The impacts of fisheries on ocean resources are no longer considered in isolation but should account for broader ecosystem effects. However, ongoing ecosystem-wide changes added to the inherent dynamics of marine ecosystems, create challenges for fisheries and fisheries management by affecting our ability to ensure future fishing opportunities and sustainable use of the seas. By reviewing a corpus of fisheries science literature, we contribute to informing managers and policymakers with considerations of the various threats to fisheries and the marine ecosystems that support them. We identify and describe 25 ecosystem challenges and 7 prominent families of management options to address them. We capture the challenges acting within three broad categories: (i) fishing impacts on the marine environments and future fishing opportunities, (ii) effects of environmental conditions on fish and fishing opportunities, and (iii) effects of context in terms of socioeconomics, fisheries management, and institutional set-up on fisheries. Our review shows that, while most EU fisheries are facing a similar array of challenges, some of them are specific to regions or individual fisheries. This is reflected in selected regional cases taking different perspectives to exemplify the challenges along with fishery-specific cases. These cases include the dramatic situation of the Baltic Sea cod, facing an array of cumulative pressures, the multiple and moving ecosystem interactions that rely on the North Sea forage fish facing climate change, the interaction of fishing and fish stocks in a fluctuating mixed fishery in the Celtic Sea, the bycatch of marine mammals and seabirds and habitat degradation in the Bay of Biscay, and finally the under capacity and lack of fundamental knowledge on some features of the EU Outermost Regions. In addition to these ecoregion specific findings, we discuss the outcomes of our review across the whole of European waters and we conclude by recognizing that there are knowledge gaps regarding the direction of causality, nonlinear responses, and confounding effects. All of the challenges we identify and characterize may guide further data collection and research coordination to improve our fundamental understanding of the system and to monitor real changes within it, both of which are required to inform an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM). An European EAFM could build upon an array of management measures currently tailored for fisheries management only, including promoting funding interdisciplinary research and ecosystem monitoring. Such integrative management should reduce uncertainties in environmental, social and economic trends, and lower the risk for disruptive events or ecosystem effects with far-reaching consequences, including a shift toward less productive marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess fish stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model configuration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the ‘well-mixed single-stock' paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally efficiently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random effects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (age-size/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Efficient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the ‘Robin Hood' paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is well-documented, does not require specification of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to configure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random effects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be flexible and modifiable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},

It also fails to capture the critical role of forage fish as food for marine mammals, seabirds, and commercially important fish such as tuna, salmon, and cod.

abstract = {Indices of abundance are commonly used in fisheries stock assessment models to represent trends in population size over time; however, an index can misrepresent such trends when catchability varies, sampling gears change or spatial sampling frames shift. Here we develop a state-space model in a Bayesian framework that combines both chevron trap catches and video counts into a single integrated index. The modeling approach accounts for variation in sampling efficiency (catchability) of both sampling gears and adjusts for aspects of changes in the spatial sampling frame (sampling intensity and spatial coverage) through time due to monitoring program development. We validate the model using a simulation study and then demonstrate its utility using data on vermilion snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens from the period 1990–2016. The index suggests high variation in the abundance of vermilion snapper, particularly for years previous to 2000 and a systematic decline in abundance between the early 1990s and 2016. This pattern culminates (2016) with vermilion snapper at about 16{\%} of their average early 1990s abundance which is a stronger decline than is indicated by the current index used for stock assessment of the species.},

abstract = {Anadromous populations of striped bass occur along the Atlantic coast of the US from Maine to North Carolina. Recruitment overfishing and declining water quality led to substantial reductions in striped bass abundance during the 1970s and 1980s. Cooperative interstate fishery management of striped bass began in 1981, with the development of a fishery management plan by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an organization of Atlantic coastal states. Effective fishery management and additional research and monitoring contributed to a tenfold increase in abundance of striped bass stocks by the late 1990s. This dramatic increase resulted in increased predation on a variety of anadromous fish species including American shad, blueback herring, and alewives. Predation by striped bass on Atlantic salmon smolts in North America has been documented, but the impact of this predation has not been quantified. Moderate to strong correlations were found between estimates of striped bass abundance and the return of Atlantic salmon to three of the four major New England salmon rivers. Further research is required to quantify the proportion of smolt production consumed by striped bass, particularly for salmon populations listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

Subsequently, we propose research directions aimed to improve our understanding of the role of courtship behavior in speciation. We propose two complementary research approaches, one addressing the processes that drive the evolution of mate recognition systems and the other addressing the phenotypic architecture of behavioral isolation.

abstract = {The distributions of animal populations change and evolve through time. Migratory species exploit different habitats at different times of the year. Biotic and abiotic features that determine where a species lives vary due to natural and anthropogenic factors. This spatiotemporal variation needs to be accounted for in any modeling of species' distributions. In this paper we introduce a semiparametric model that provides a flexible framework for analyzing dynamic patterns of species occurrence and abundance from broad-scale survey data. The spatiotemporal exploratory model (STEM) adds essential spatiotemporal structure to existing techniques for developing species distribution models through a simple parametric structure without requiring a detailed understanding of the underlying dynamic processes. STEMs use a multi-scale strategy to differentiate between local and global-scale spatiotemporal structure. A user-specified species distribution model accounts for spatial and temporal patterning at the local level. These local patterns are then allowed to "scale up" via ensemble averaging to larger scales. This makes STEMs especially well suited for exploring distributional dynamics arising from a variety of processes. Using data from eBird, an online citizen science bird-monitoring project, we demonstrate that monthly changes in distribution of a migratory species, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), can be more accurately described with a STEM than a conventional bagged decision tree model in which spatiotemporal structure has not been imposed. We also demonstrate that there is no loss of model predictive power when a STEM is used to describe a spatiotemporal distribution with very little spatiotemporal variation; the distribution of a nonmigratory species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis).},

abstract = {Bayesian inference is increasingly used in estimating model parameters for fish-stock assessment, because of its ability to incorporate uncertainty and prior knowledge and to provide information for risk analyses in evaluating alternative management strategies. Normal distributions are commonly used in formulating likelihood functions and informative prior distributions; these are sensitive to data outliers and mis-specification of prior distributions, both common problems in fisheries-stock assessment. Using a length-structured stock-assessment model for a New Zealand abalone fishery as an example, we evaluate the robustness of three likelihood functions and two prior-distribution functions, with respect to outliers and mis-specification of priors, in 48 different combinations. The two robust likelihood estimators performed slightly less well when no data outliers were present and much better when data outliers were present. Similarly, the Cauchy distribution was less sensitive to prior mis-specification than the normal distribution. We conclude that replacing the normal distribution with "fat-tailed" distributions for likelihoods and priors can improve Bayesian assessments when there are data outliers and mis-specification of priors, with relatively minor costs when there are none.},

@article{Orr2000,
abstract = {Background: Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is a rare skin disease, mostly seen on the legs and often occurring in patients with diabetes mellitus. The disease belongs to the idiopathic cutaneous palisading granulomatous dermatitides associated with a degeneration of collagen, thus leading to skin atrophy. Application of topical corticosteroids is the most widely used treatment but the results are not always satisfactory and may worsen skin atrophy. Preliminary studies in patients with NL have shown a clinical response with psoralen plus ultraviolet (UV) A (PUVA). Objectives: To study the effect of topical PUVA on NL in a multicentre prospective study. Methods: Thirty patients (27 women and three men) including 13 with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, with a diagnosis of NL proven by histopathology, were included. All patients had been unsuccessfully treated with topical and/or intralesional corticosteroids. Patients were treated twice weekly with an aqueous gel containing 0.005{\%} psoralen followed by irradiation with UVA. Clinical photographs were taken for evaluation. In addition, 20-MHz high-frequency ultrasound analysis was performed in 10 patients to evaluate the thickness and density of the dermis during topical PUVA therapy. Results: Five patients (17{\%}) showed complete clearing (healing of ulceration and disappearance of erythema) after a mean of 22 exposures (range 15-30). Eleven patients (37{\%}) showed improvement, defined as healing of ulceration and/or reduction of erythema, after a mean of 23 exposures (range 11-42). Ten patients (33{\%}) showed no effect and four patients (13{\%}) worsened during topical PUVA therapy. The treatment results of the patients who suffered from diabetes mellitus were not different from those who did not have diabetes mellitus. No difference was seen in mean dermal thickness (1666 vs. 1706 mum) and density (17 vs. 16 units) before and after topical PUVA therapy. Side-effects were seen in 10 patients: hyperpigmentation (n = 4), blistering (n = 4) and bacterial infection (n = 2). Conclusions: Topical PUVA may be a useful treatment modality for NL in patients not responding to topical or intralesional corticosteroids.},

abstract = {The incidental capture, or bycatch, of loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta in commercial fishing gear is considered a significant threat to their recovery. Bycatch analyses that use fishery-dependent data only reflect the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of turtles and fishing effort and therefore do not directly reveal conditions associated with turtle distributions. Fishery-independent and -dependent data can be used together to identify environmental conditions associated with turtle presence and the subsequent risk of a bycatch encounter if fishing effort is present. We developed generalized additive models (GAMs) to describe fishery-independent encounter rates of loggerheads observed in aerial and resource surveys in the US mid-Atlantic region as a function of environmental variables. We then fit a fishery-independent GAM to fishery-dependent data collected from commercial gillnet, bottom trawl, and scallop dredge fisheries in the mid-Atlantic region, and tested the model on new fishery-dependent data to assess how well the model predicted bycatch events. The preferred model describes fishery-independent encounter rates as a function of latitude, sea-surface temperature, depth, and salinity. When this model was fit to fishery-dependent data and tested on new data, it predicted 85{\%} of the observed bycatch events when grouped by latitude and season, although it underestimated bycatch events in southern latitudes in winter. We identify times and areas of elevated bycatch risk on which to focus future conservation efforts and observer coverage.},

abstract = {The temporal dynamics and spatial distributions of zooplankton in the tidal freshwater portion of the Hudson River were studied over a 3-yr period. We tested the hypothesis that advective transport regulates zooplankton biomass in the Hudson and in lakes, estuaries, and rivers for which we have published values. In the Hudson, zooplankton biomass was negatively correlated with discharge over the entire season (P {\textless} 0.0001) as well as during the warmer period of the year (P = 0.007) when biomass was greatest. The spatial distribution of zooplankton over 160-km transects was heterogeneous. Downstream changes in the abundance of a dominant species, Bosmina longirostris, indicate that certain areas of the river support net population growth whereas other areas are population sinks. We infer that zooplankton biomass in the Hudson is a function of the balance between reproduction determined by resources and losses due to advection. Zooplankton biomass differs among lakes, estuaries, and rivers in a manner consistent with the differences in water residence time. Biomass is highest in lakes, lower in saline estuaries and tidal rivers, and lowest in rivers. Advective losses appear to be important in explaining differences between planktonic communities in lentic and lotic environments.},

abstract = {This paper explores the topic of preferential sampling, specifically situations where monitoring sites in environmental networks are preferentially located by the designers. This means the data arising from such networks may not accurately characterize the spatio-temporal field they intend to monitor. Approaches that have been developed to mitigate the effects of preferential sampling in various contexts are reviewed and, building on these approaches, a general framework for dealing with the effects of preferential sampling in environmental monitoring is proposed. Strategies for implementation are proposed, leading to a method for improving the accuracy of official statistics used to report trends and inform regulatory policy. An essential feature of the method is its capacity to learn the preferential selection process over time and hence to reduce bias in these statistics. Simulation studies suggest dramatic reductions in bias are possible. A case study demonstrates use of the method in assessing the levels of air pollution due to black smoke in the UK over an extended period (1970-1996). In particular, dramatic reductions in the estimates of the number of sites out of compliance are observed.},

abstract = {Various population structures or spatial heterogeneities in population distribution have been an important source of model misspecification and have had an impact on estimation performance in fisheries stock assessment. In this study, we simulated the Indian Ocean albacore spatial heterogeneity in age-structure using Stock Synthesis according to the stage-dependent migration rate and region-dependent fishing mortality rate and generated the stock assessment data. Based on these data, we investigated the performances of different spatial configurations, selectivity curves and selections of CPUE (catch per unit effort) indices of the assessment models which were used to account for spatial heterogeneity. The results showed: (1) although the spatially explicit configurations, which exactly matched the operating model, provided unbiased and accurate estimates of relative spawning biomass, relative fishing mortality rate and maximum sustainable yield in all simulation scenarios, their performance may be very poor if there were mismatches between them and the operating model due to gaps in knowledge and data; (2) for spatially explicit assessment configuration, the correct boundary was required, but for non-spatially explicit assessment configuration, it seemed more important for analysts to partition the area to properly reflect the transition in field data and to effectively account for the impacts of ignoring the spatial structure by using the additional spatially referenced parameters; (3) although the areas-as-fleets methods and flexible time-varying selectivity curves could be used as better alternative approaches to account for spatial structure, these configurations could not completely eliminate the impacts of model misspecification and the quality of estimates of different quantities from the same assessment model may be inconsistent or the performance of the same assessment configuration may fluctuate significantly between simulation scenarios; (4) although the worst estimates could generally be avoided by using multiple CPUE indices, there were no best solutions to select or regenerate the CPUE indices to account for the impacts of the ignored spatial structure to obviously improve the quality of stock assessment. Compared with the results of assessment model configurations which are used to account for the spatial structure by different modelers, the performances of the configurations are always casespecific except for spatially explicit configurations which exactly match the operating model. In this sense, our study will not only provide some insights into the current Indian Ocean albacore stock assessment but also enrich existing knowledge regarding the performance of assessment configurations to account for spatial structure.},

On a local scale, no relationship between latitude (10⚬ to 49⚬ N.) and diversity was found. On a geographic scale, an increased stability of annual production may lead to an increased capacity for systems to support higher-level carnivores. Hence tropical, or other, ecosystems are more diverse, and are characterized by disproportionately more carnivores.},

However, which spatiotemporal model framework to use for generating these predictions is unclear. We evaluated a relatively new method, Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs), with two other frameworks, generalized additive models (GAMs) and random forests. We fit geostatistical delta-models to fisheries observer bycatch data for six species with a broad range of movement patterns (e.g., highly migratory sea turtles versus sedentary rockfish) and bycatch rates (percentage of observations with nonzero catch, 0.3{\%}–96.2{\%}). Random forests had better interpolation performance than the GMRF and GAM models for all six species, but random forests performance was more sensitive when predicting data at the edge of the fishery (i.e., spatial extrapolation). Using random forests to identify and remove the 5{\%} highest bycatch risk fishing events reduced the bycatch-to-target species catch ratio by 34{\%} on average. All models considerably reduced the bycatch-to-target ratio, demonstrating the clear potential of species distribution models to support spatial fishery management.},

abstract = {Abstract. One of the oldest problems in evolutionary biology remains largely unsolved. Which mutations generate evolutionarily relevant phenotypic variation? What kinds of molecular changes do they entail? What are the phenotypic magnitudes, frequencies of origin, and pleiotropic effects of such mutations? How is the genome constructed to allow the observed abundance of phenotypic diversity? Historically, the neo?Darwinian synthesizers stressed the predominance of micromutations in evolution, whereas others noted the similarities between some dramatic mutations and evolutionary transitions to argue for macromutationism. Arguments on both sides have been biased by misconceptions of the developmental effects of mutations. For example, the traditional view that mutations of important developmental genes always have large pleiotropic effects can now be seen to be a conclusion drawn from observations of a small class of mutations with dramatic effects. It is possible that some mutations, for example, those in cis?regulatory DNA, have few or no pleiotropic effects and may be the predominant source of morphological evolution. In contrast, mutations causing dramatic phenotypic effects, although superficially similar to hypothesized evolutionary transitions, are unlikely to fairly represent the true path of evolution. Recent developmental studies of gene function provide a new way of conceptualizing and studying variation that contrasts with the traditional genetic view that was incorporated into neo?Darwinian theory and population genetics. This new approach in developmental biology is as important for micro?evolutionary studies as the actual results from recent evolutionary developmental studies. In particular, this approach will assist in the task of identifying the specific mutations generating phenotypic variation and elucidating how they alter gene function. These data will provide the current missing link between molecular and phenotypic variation in natural populations.},

abstract = {The controversy over the evolutionary advantage of recombination initially discovered by Fisher and by Muller is reviewed. Those authors whose models had finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite populations found none. The advantage of recombination is that it breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic drift. Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher and Muller. It also predicts the "ratchet mechanism" discovered by Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of accounting for its origin.},

abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.: S 0 3 0 4-3 8 0 0 (0 0) 0 0 3 5 4-9},

abstract = {Fisheries managers use biological reference points (BRPs) as targets or limits on fishing and biomass to maintain productive levels of fish stock biomass. There are multiple ways to calculate BRPs when biological parameters are time varying. Using summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) as a case study, we investigated time-varying approaches in concert with climate-linked population models to understand the impact of environmentally driven variability in natural mortality, recruitment, and size-At-Age on two commonly used BRPs [B0(t) and F35{\%}(t)]. We used the following two approaches to calculate time-varying BRPs: dynamic-BRP and moving-Average-BRP. We quantified the variability and uncertainty of different climate dependencies and estimation approaches, attributed BRP variation to variation in life-history processes, and evaluated how using different approaches impacts estimates of stock status. Results indicate that the dynamic-BRP approach using the climate-linked natural mortality model produced the least variable reference points compared to others calculated. Summer flounder stock status depended on the estimation approach and climate model used. These results emphasize that understanding climate dependencies is important for summer flounder reference points and perhaps other species, and careful consideration is warranted when considering what time-varying approach to use, ideally based upon simulation studies within a proposed set of management procedures.},

abstract = {Statistical catch-at-age analysis (SCAA) allows analysts to explicitly account for process and observation errors in their stock assessment models. The variances associated with these errors are important because they weight the different data and error sources during the model fitting process. Misspecification of the error variances can lead to biased estimates of key management quantities. Values for the error variances commonly are obtained separately from SCAA and treated as known in the subsequent analysis. The advantages of estimating the error variances within SCAA include that all of the data available to the analysis can be synthesized to obtain the variance estimates and, with some methods, uncertainty surrounding the variance estimates can be quantified. We evaluated alternative approaches for estimating log catchability (process error) and log total catch (observation error) standard deviations within SCAA using Monte Carlo simulations: an ad hoc approach that tunes the model predicted log total catch standard deviation to match a prior value, and a Bayesian approach using either strongly or weakly informative priors for log catchability standard deviation. The Bayesian approach using strongly informative priors outperformed the other approaches in estimating the log total catch and log catchability standard deviations, as well as estimating biomass in the last year of analysis. The ad hoc approach produced misleading results which could indicate that total variance (i.e., process error variance plus observation error variance) was well estimated when, in fact, total variance was underestimated.},

abstract = {In marine invertebrate populations natural mortality events tend to be episodic in nature. The impact of these episodic mortality events can be estimated from the decline in catch rate of live animals over time obtained through successive population sampling. However, the high variability of catch rates makes them relatively insensitive indicators of mortality. For bivalve mollusks another means to estimate mortality is to assess the change in abundance of recently dead animals, called clappers, which are gaping shells still hinged together. We present a change in ratio estimator and its associated variance of the proportion of animals dying due to an episodic mortality event. This estimator is more sensitive to mortality events and may be preferable to a traditional estimator based upon changes in catch rates of live animals. When applied to a scallop population in Narragansett Bay, RI, the change in ratio estimator indicated that a 72{\%} reduction in the population occurred after an intense mortality event associated with an epizootic of a rickettsia-like organism. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

SUMMARY Gibbs sampling has enormous potential for analysing complex data sets. However, routine use of Gibbs sampling has been hampered by the lack of general purpose software for its implementation. Until now all applications have involved writing one-off computer code in low or intermediate level languages such as C or Fortran. We describe some general purpose software that we are currently developing for implementing Gibbs sampling: BUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling). The BUGS system comprises three components: first, a natural language for specifying complex models; second, an 'expert system' for deciding appropriate methods for obtaining samples required by the Gibbs sampler; third, a sampling module containing numerical routines to perform the sampling. S objects are used for data input and output. BUGS is written in Modula-2 and runs under both DOS and UNIX.},

Moreover, we show that intuition and approximations derived from asymptotics using a fixed range parameter can be problematic when applied to finite samples, even for large sample sizes. In contrast, we show via simulation that performance is improved and asymptotic approximations are applicable for smaller sample sizes when the parameters are jointly estimated. These effects are particularly apparent when the process is mean square differentiable or the effective range of spatial correlation is small. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biometrika Trust.},

abstract = {Delta-models (a.k.a. hurdle models) are widely used to fit biomass samples that include zeros and a skewed response for positive catches, and spatio-temporal extensions of these models are increasingly used to quantify trends in abundance (i.e., estimate abundance indices). Previous research has shown estimated indices are proportional to changes in abundance. However, little research has tested the performance of delta-models for estimating “scale”; that is, whether abundance indices are not just proportional to population changes but also have the correct absolute value. We use data for twenty species in the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska as well as a factorial experiment conditioned on data for Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod to support five conclusions related to scale in spatio-temporal delta-models. First, we show that conventional (nonspatial) delta-models are surprisingly sensitive to the a priori choice of probability distribution for positive catches, where gamma and Tweedie models give similar scale estimates but other distributions generally differ. Second, these same distributions also estimate widely different scales when using spatio-temporal delta-models, and the delta-gamma and Tweedie models provide similar scale to design-based indices. Third, model selection using marginal AIC often identifies the lognormal distribution as most parsimonious, despite it resulting in systematically higher abundance than design-based indices for many species. Fourth, scale is sensitive to the spatial resolution (i.e., number of knots) used in fitting the spatio-temporal model when using a na{\"{i}}ve “empirical Bayes” estimator, but less sensitive when applying an epsilon bias-correction estimator. Fifth, the factorial simulation experiment suggests that the Tweedie and delta-gamma distributions perform well even when applied to data simulated from an inverse-Gaussian or lognormal distribution, whereas the opposite is not true. We conclude that index scale is sensitive to delta-model specification, and we make five recommendations when using spatio-temporal delta-models for index standardization: (1) apply the epsilon or other bias-correction methods to reduce sensitivity of index scale on spatio-temporal model resolution; either (2) compare the scale of delta-model indices with that of design-based indices when design-based indices are available or (3) use the delta-gamma or Tweedie distribution by default when design-based indices are not available; (4) do not assume that AIC will identify the model specification that results in the most appropriate scale; and (5) consider apparent mismatches in index scale depending upon whether an assessment model specifies or estimates the associated catchability coefficient and whether the design-based index is believed to measure total abundance for a fully-selected age or length-class.},

abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

@article{Richmond2006,
abstract = {In June 1909, scientists and dignitaries from 167 different countries gathered in Cambridge to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth and the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Origin of Species. The event was one of the most magnificent commemorations in the annals of science. Delegates gathered within the cloisters of Cambridge University not only to honor the "hero" of evolution but also to reassess the underpinnings of Darwinism at a critical juncture. With the mechanism of natural selection increasingly under attack, evolutionary theory was in disarray. Against this backdrop, biologists weighed the impact of several new developments--the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of heredity, de Vriesian mutation theory, and the linkage of sex-cell division (recently named "meiosis") to the mechanism of heredity. The 1909 Darwin celebration thus represents a significant watershed in the history of modem biology that allows historians to assess the status of evolution prior to the advent of the chromosome theory of genetics.},

The year of the lowest observed biomass of spawners did not correspond to low juvenile survival for the cohorts that should have contributed to the stock in that year. However, fishing mortality was very high for the years preceding the collapse. The collapse of the cod stocks was not caused by a lack of resilience at low population abundance because all spawners were able to produce many potential replacements at low population size. We show that as populations collapsed, fishing mortality increased until the populations were reduced to very low levels. We conclude that increased fishing mortality caused the population declines, and often the collapses, of the cod stocks.},

abstract = {Several methods used in fisheries stock assessment models that can be applied to population viability analysis are presented. (1) Integrated analysis allows the use of all information on a particular population, and ensures that all model assumptions and parameter are consistent throughout the analysis, that uncertainty is propagated throughout the analysis, and that the correlation among parameters is preserved. (2) Bayesian analysis allows for the inclusion of prior information, and is a convenient way to represent uncertainty. (3) Random-effects models based on hierarchical modeling allow information to be shared among parameter estimates and allow the separation of process error from estimation error. (4) Non-parametric representation of parameters allows for a more flexible relationship among the parameters. (5) Robust likelihood functions provide an automatic method to reduce the influence of outliers when the data sets are large.

abstract = {Marine recreational fisheries (MRFs) are often highly spatially heterogenous, with effort concentrated into small areas, and fisheries spanning large environmental gradients. However, spatially resolved catch data is rarely collected in MRFs, preventing the study of spatial heterogeneity in catch. This study uses recreational catch reported in 10 * 10 nm blocks across eight degrees of latitude in Western Australia to map spatial predictions of the probability of a recreational catch on an average trip for two key species: West Australian dhufish (Glaucosoma hebraicum) and snapper (Chrysophrys auratus). Two spatial modelling techniques are compared for the analysis, generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs). We find that BRTs outperform GAMMs, but performance gains are small. We also find marked spatial variations in recreational catch probabilities: high catches of dhufish are found in the north of the study area, and low catches in the Perth Metropolitan area and in the south; snapper catches are highest in the north and low in the south. These patterns are used to identify important spatial processes in the fishery. The analysis also suggests that modelling approach (GAMMs or BRTs) has only a minor effect on outcomes of spatial catch analysis in MRFs.},

@article{Underwood2009,
abstract = {Coral reefs are in decline worldwide, and marine reserve networks have been advocated as a powerful management tool for maximizing the resilience of coral communities to an increasing variety, number, and severity of disturbances. However, the effective design of reserves must account for the spatial scales of larval dispersal that affect the demography of communities over ecological time frames. Ecologically relevant distances of dispersal were inferred from DNA microsatellite data in a broadcast-spawning (Acropora tenuis) and a brooding (Seriatopora hystrix) coral at isolated reef systems off northwest Australia. Congruent with expectations based on life histories, levels of genetic subdivision among populations were markedly higher in the brooder than in the broadcast spawner. Additionally, significant subdivision for both species between systems ({\textgreater}100 km), and between ({\textgreater}10 km) or within reefs ({\textless}10 km) within systems, indicated that many reefs or reef patches are demographically independent. There was also a clear distinction in the scale of genetic structure between the different systems; at the more geographically complex of the systems, a much finer scale structure was detected in both species. This suggested that the hydrodynamics associated with these complex reefs restrict distances regularly traveled by larvae. The primary implication is that short-term recovery of these coral communities after severe disturbance requires the input of larvae from viable communities kilometers to a few tens of kilometers away. Therefore, to be self-sustaining, we suggest that coral reef protected areas need to be large enough to encompass these routine dispersal distances. Further, to facilitate recovery from severe disturbances, protected areas need to be replicated over these spatial scales. However, specific designs also need to account for size, complexity, and isolation of reefs, which will either restrict or enhance dispersal within this range.},

Photoprotection: pigments protect against photoinhibition or photooxidation allowing a more efficient recovery of nutrients. Drought resistance: pigments decrease osmotic potential allowing leaves to tolerate water stress. Leaf warming: pigments convert light into heat and warm leaves. Fruit flag: colour attracts animals that help disperse seeds. Coevolution: colour signals that the tree is not a suitable host for insects. Camouflage: colour makes leaves less detectable to herbivores. Anticamouflage: colour enhances conspicuousness of parasites dwelling on leaves to predators or parasitoids. Unpalatability: pigments act as direct anti-feedants against herbivores. Reduced nutrient loss: yellow leaves have less to lose against herbivory. Tritrophic mutualism: colour attracts aphids which attract ants that defend the trees from other insects. For each hypothesis I mention the original references, I define assumptions and predictions, and I discuss briefly conceptual problems and available evidence.},

abstract = {Changes in streamflow and water table elevation influence oxidation‐reduction (redox) conditions near river‐aquifer interfaces, with potentially important consequences for solute fluxes and biogeochemical reaction rates. While continuous measurements of groundwater chemistry can be arduous, in‐situ sensors reveal chemistry dynamics across a wide range of timescales. We monitored redox potential in an aquifer adjacent to a tidal river and use spectral and wavelet analyses to link redox responses to hydrologic perturbations within the bed and banks. Storms perturb redox potential within both the bed and banks over timescales of days to weeks. Tides drive semi‐diurnal oscillations in redox potential within the streambed that are absent in the banks. Wavelet analysis shows that tidal redox oscillations in the bed are greatest during late summer (wavelet magnitude of 5.62 mV) when river stage fluctuations are on the order of 70 cm and microbial activity is relatively high. Tidal redox oscillations diminish during the winter (wavelet magnitude of 2.73 mV) when river stage fluctuations are smaller (on the order of 50 cm) and microbial activity is presumably low. While traditional geochemical observations are often limited to summer baseflow conditions, in‐situ redox sensing provides continuous, high‐resolution chemical characterization of the subsurface, revealing transport and reaction processes across spatial and temporal scales in aquifers.},

abstract = {The classical tools in spatial statistics are stationary models, like the Mat{\'{e}}rn field. However, in some applications there are boundaries, holes, or physical barriers in the study area, e.g. a coastline, and stationary models will inappropriately smooth over these features, requiring the use of a non-stationary model. We propose a new model, the Barrier model, which is different from the established methods as it is not based on the shortest distance around the physical barrier, nor on boundary conditions. The Barrier model is based on viewing the Mat{\'{e}}rn correlation, not as a correlation function on the shortest distance between two points, but as a collection of paths through a Simultaneous Autoregressive (SAR) model. We then manipulate these local dependencies to cut off paths that are crossing the physical barriers. To make the new SAR well behaved, we formulate it as a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) that can be discretised to represent the Gaussian field, with a sparse precision matrix that is automatically positive definite. The main advantage with the Barrier model is that the computational cost is the same as for the stationary model. The model is easy to use, and can deal with both sparse data and very complex barriers, as shown in an application in the Finnish Archipelago Sea. Additionally, the Barrier model is better at reconstructing the modified Horseshoe test function than the standard models used in R-INLA.},

Egg deposition and water quality were monitored in the Stewiacke River about 2 km downstream of the spawning grounds from May 23 to June 15, 1994. Replicate samples taken every 1.5 h (16 times/d) were cued to within 30 min before and after the tidal bore and 15 min after high slack tide. On spring tide, the tidal bore and flood tide changed the river elevation 3.7 m and the salinity from 0 parts per thousand to 20 parts per thousand within 1 h; neap tide changes were the smallest measured during the study. Three major spawning peaks were observed: June 2-4, 6-9, and 13-14. Major spawning activity was cued to the neap tide, which had the smallest fluctuations in salinity (0-8 parts per thousand) and temperature (16.2-18.1 degrees C) and the greatest water clarity (10-45 cm). Major spawning activity commenced when water temperature reached 18 degrees C; water temperatures fluctuated more with tidal cycle than with seasonal progression. Approximately 67{\%} of the eggs collected were less than 10 h old, and 9{\%} were 30 or more hours old. Only 61 larvae were collected. Total estimated egg production (+/-SD) for this population in 1994 was 106.185 +/- 10.6 million, based on all eggs less than 10 h old caught in paired surface and paired bottom nets. Most eggs less than 10 h old were collected during ebbing tides at water velocities below 0.4 m/s, water temperatures of 18.0-21.9 degrees C, and salinities of 0-1.9 parts per thousand. Unfertilized eggs had a density of 1.0016 at 17 degrees C, eggs less than 10 h old had a density of 1.0029, and eggs with fully developed larvae had a density between 1.0060 and 1.0066. Youngest eggs were most buoyant, and oldest eggs were heavier, which probably plays an important role in the eggs being retained within lowest salinity waters and within or near the tidal bore on hood tides until hatching. Shubenacadie striped bass apparently require environmental conditions similar to populations in other watersheds, but the fate of eggs and larvae in this system is quite different, which are factors that should be considered if this population is used in aquaculture programs or population restocking efforts.},

The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects ({\~{}}10{\^{}}6) and parameters ({\~{}}10{\^{}}3). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field.

abstract = {A reliable measure of gear capture efficiency is required to calculate unbiased estimates of population size and fishing mortality from survey data in a stock assessment. However, capture efficiency can vary spatially and temporally due to changes in abundance, stock area, the environment, and the sampling gear itself. Therefore, periodic reassessment of this parameter is necessary to ensure that the catchability coefficients being applied accurately reflect the capture efficiency of the survey sampling gear, especially when catchability is being estimated outside of the stock assessment model. Using data from field experiments conducted in 1999, 2000, 2003, and 2013, we evaluated spatial and temporal variability in capture efficiency for a commercial dredge used to conduct a fishery-independent survey of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) population in Delaware Bay, USA. A spatial gradient in capture efficiency was detected, but no temporal trend. Capture efficiency was a function of the density of oysters in the sampled area. To our knowledge this is the first time density-dependent capture efficiency has been identified for a sessile invertebrate stock survey. Since density dependence in capture efficiency leads to hyperstable catch-per-unit-effort, caution is advised when deriving oyster abundance from dredge survey catch-per-effort data, especially at low oyster density and when high spatial resolution estimates of survey dredge capture efficiency are not available.},

abstract = {Abstract A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse (GI) modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The GI penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations (SWEs). To make representer computations efficient, the SWEs are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order SWE system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized GI penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the SWE, with soft momentum balance constraints (e.g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints.

Such tools are essential with overfishing now reducing stocks and employment worldwide, with in turn many serious social, economic, and environmental implications. Increasingly, a state-space framework is being used in place of deterministic and standard parametric stock assessment models. These efforts have not only had considerable impact on fisheries management but have also advanced the supporting statistical theory and inference tools as well as the required software.

abstract = {A Bayesian approach to parameter estimation in fisheries stock assessment is often preferred over maximum likelihood estimates, and fisheries management guidelines also sometimes specify that one or the other paradigm be used. However, important issues remain unresolved for the Bayesian approach to stock assessment despite over 25 years of research, development, and application. Here, we explore the consequence of a common practice in Bayesian assessment models: assigning a uniform prior to the logarithm of the parameter representing population scale (log-carrying capacity for biomass-dynamics models, or log-unfished recruits for age-structured models). First, we explain why the value chosen for the upper bound of this prior will affect parameter estimates and fisheries management advice given two properties that are met for many data-poor stock assessment models. Next, we use three case studies and a simulation experiment to show a substantial impact of this decision for data-limited assessments off the US West Coast. We end by discussing four methods for generating an informative prior on the population scale parameter, but conclude that these will not be suitable for many assessments. In these cases, we advocate that maximum likelihood estimation is a simple way to avoid the use of Bayesian priors that are excessively informative.},

abstract = { Bycatch in commercial fisheries is a pressing conservation concern and has spurred global interest in adopting ecosystem-based management practices. To address such concerns, a thorough understanding of spatiotemporal relationships among bycatch species, their environment and fisheries is required. Here we used a generalized linear mixed model framework incorporating spatiotemporal random effects to model abundance patterns for 3 skate species caught as bycatch in commercial fisheries (thorny skate Amblyraja radiata , winter skate Leucoraja ocellata and smooth skate Malacoraja senta ), as well as 10 target species on the Scotian Shelf, NW Atlantic. Spatiotemporal estimates of relative abundance for at-risk skates within the years 2005-2015 were modelled from research trawl survey data and overlaid with those for target species to identify hotspots of bycatch risk. In addition, abundance estimates for at-risk skates within the years 1975-1985, a period of higher stock abundance, were used to identify areas of previously important habitat. Historically, skate species densely occupied areas near Sable Island and Banquereau Banks, Georges Bank and the Bay of Fundy. Bycatch hotspots between at-risk skates and commercial targets were identified in regions across the Scotian Shelf. These hotspots were independently validated by predicting species presence from at-sea observer data that monitor skate bycatch directly. We discuss spatial relationships between target and bycatch species, highlighting limitations of at-sea observer programmes that this method helps to address. This framework can be applied more broadly to inform ecosystem management and priority areas for conservation or fisheries regulation. },

abstract = {Larval dispersal is the key process by which populations of most marine fishes and invertebrates are connected and replenished. Advances in larval tagging and genetics have enhanced our capacity to track larval dispersal, assess scales of population connectivity, and quantify larval exchange among no-take marine reserves and fished areas. Recent studies have found that reserves can be a significant source of recruits for populations up to 40 km away, but the scale and direction of larval connectivity across larger seascapes remain unknown. Here, we apply genetic parentage analysis to investigate larval dispersal patterns for two exploited coral reef groupers (Plectropomus maculatus and Plectropomus leopardus) within and among three clusters of reefs separated by 60–220 km within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. A total of 69 juvenile P. maculatus and 17 juvenile P. leopardus (representing 6{\%} and 9{\%} of the total juveniles sampled, respectively) were genetically assigned to parent individuals on reefs within the study area. We identified both short-distance larval dispersal within regions (200 m to 50 km) and long-distance, multidirectional dispersal of up to {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}250 km among regions. Dispersal strength declined significantly with distance, with best-fit dispersal kernels estimating median dispersal distances of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}110 km for P. maculatus and {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}190 km for P. leopardus. Larval exchange among reefs demonstrates that established reserves form a highly connected network and contribute larvae for the replenishment of fished reefs at multiple spatial scales. Our findings highlight the potential for long-distance dispersal in an important group of reef fishes, and provide further evidence that effectively protected reserves can yield recruitment and sustainability benefits for exploited fish populations.},

abstract = {Early in the 20th century, Johan Hjort developed compelling arguments and hypotheses to explain recruitment variability that became dominant for more than 75 years. A cautious emergence from Hjorts shadow began late in the 20th century. Hjorts Critical Period hypothesis, i.e., failure of first-feeding larvae to find food, and a second hypothesis, Aberrant Drift of eggs and larvae, were proposed to explain causes of recruitment variability. Tests of the Critical Period hypothesis became an obsession, although support for it was inconsistent and equivocal. Single-minded research on the Critical Period hypothesis gave way to realization that recruitment variability was the outcome of complex trophodynamic and physical processes acting over many temporal and spatial scales and throughout pre-recruit life. A complex mix of main effects and interacting factors can easily generate order-ofmagnitude variability in recruitment via small effects on mortality and growth rates during the abundant egg and larval stages, or via cumulative effects during the pre-recruit juvenile stage. New considerations of compensatory mechanisms that can dampen variability and stabilize recruitment emerged. A little density dependence, especially in the relatively long juvenile stage, can regulate recruitment. Multidisciplinary programs instituted in the 1990s and successful development of statistical models and coupled bio-physical models, offered new insights into mechanisms generating recruitment variability. Despite progress, forecasting recruitment remains a formidable challenge. Solving the recruitment problem is no longer the Holy Grail of fishery science. Appreciating recruitment variability, explaining its probable causes, considering implications for management, and understanding it in the context of broader variability in marine ecosystems, are all worthy goals.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Published by International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017. Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. "joint species distribution" or "multispecies occupancy" models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed "biogenic habitat") improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

abstract = {The dispersal of individuals among marine populations is of great importance to meta-population dynamics, population persistence, and species expansion. Understanding this connectivity between distant populations is key to their effective conservation and management. For many marine species, population connectivity is determined largely by ocean currents transporting larvae and juveniles between distant patches of suitable habitat. Recent work has focused on the biophysics of marine larval dispersal and its importance to population dynamics, although few studies have evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of this potential dispersal. Here, we show how an Eulerian advection-diffusion approach can be used to model the dispersal of coral larvae between reefs throughout the Tropical Pacific. We illustrate how this connectivity can be analyzed using graph theory-an effective approach for exploring patterns in spatial connections, as well as for determining the importance of each site and pathway to local and regional connectivity. Results indicate that the scale (average distance) of dispersal in the Pacific is on the order of 50-150 km, consistent with recent studies in the Caribbean (Cowen, et al. 2006). Patterns in the dispersal graphs highlight pathways for larval dispersal along major ocean currents and through island chains. A series of critical island,stepping stones' are discovered providing potential pathways across the equatorial currents and connecting distant island groups. Patterns in these dispersal graphs highlight possible pathways for species expansions, reveal connected upstream/downstream populations, and suggest areas that might be prioritized for marine conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. “joint species distribution” or “multispecies occupancy” models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed “biogenic habitat”) improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

abstract = {Age-structured production models (ASPMs) are often preferred over biomass aggregated surplus production models (SPMs) as the former can track the propagation of cohorts and explicitly account for the effects of selective fishing, even in the absence of reliable size- or age data. Here, we introduce ‘JABBA-Select', an extension of the JABBA software (Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment; Winker et al., 2018), that is able to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional SPMs and allows a direct comparison to ASPMs. JABBA-Select incorporates life history parameters and fishing selectivity and distinguishes between exploitable biomass (used to fit indices given fishery selectivity) and spawning biomass (used to predict surplus production). Applying JABBA-Select involves using an age-structured equilibrium model to convert the input parameters into multivariate normal priors for surplus-production productivity parameters. We illustrate the main elements of JABBA-Select using the stock parameters of South African silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus, Scienidae) as a case study. This species is exploited by multiple fisheries and was selected as an example of a data moderate fishery that features strong contrast in selectivity over time and across fleets. For proof-of-concept, we use an age-structured simulation framework to compare the performance of JABBA-Select to: 1) a conventional Bayesian state-space model using a Pella-Tomlinson (PT) production function, 2) an ASPM with deterministic recruitment; and 3) an ASPM with stochastic recruitment. The PT model produced biased estimates of relative and absolute spawning biomass trajectories and associated reference points, which by contrast could be fairly accurately estimated by JABBA-Select. JABBA-Select performed at least as well as the ASPMs in accuracy for most of the performance metrics and best characterized the stock status uncertainty. The results indicate that JABBA-Select is able to accurately account for moderate changes in selectivity and fleet dynamics over time and to provide a robust tool for data-moderate stock assessments.},

abstract = {There is now a large literature on ecosystem-based management (EBM; also known as the ecosystem approach). Our sense is that EBM is moving - albeit slowly - from the "what's, why's and when's" to the "how's" of operationalization and implementation; as such it seemed timely to develop this article theme set (TS). Our objectives were to ascertain the state of the discipline and to advance EBM by offering practical examples of its implementation - or attempts at such - in a variety of incarnations and at various scales, including what has or has not worked, suggestions for best practice, and lessons learned. As exemplified by the articles in this TS, key lessons learned include the need for: constant and clear communication with all parties involved; clear objectives and governance; the distillation of complex ecosystem information into digestible indicators; the establishment of reference levels on which management decisions can be made; and clear protocols to evaluate tradeoffs. Instances of truly multisectoral EBM remain rare, with EBM having advanced farthest within specific ocean-use sectors. Although progress towards implementing operational EBM has been somewhat limited, and although EBM is by its very nature complex and difficult to operationalize, there has been progress nonetheless. We hope that this TS will encourage even further operationalization of EBM.},

abstract = {In fisheries where there is a limit on total catch in a given period, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data may not be proportional to abundance because catches may be censored at the limit. Commonly used depletion estimators (e.g., Leslie method) could be biased when ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is used to estimate abundance with censored CPUE data. We used simulations to examine the performance of OLS regression and a censored regression approach when estimating abundance and exploitation using censored CPUE data over a range of known exploitation rates. We also applied the censored regression approach to data from a commercial fishery for the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). The censored regression approach always performed better than the OLS regression when estimating abundance and exploitation in our simulations. Harvest and abundance of oysters in Fishing Bay, Maryland, increased during 2009 to 2013 and then decreased through 2016, while exploitation rates had no substantial trend over time. The censored regression approach is useful for estimating abundance and exploitation when the distribution of CPUE is affected by daily catch limits.},

abstract = {Abstract: Growth rate in ectotherms, including most fish, is a function of temperature. For decades, agriculturalists (270+ years) and entomologists (45+ years) have recognized the thermal integral, known as the growing degree-day (GDD, °C{\textperiodcentered}day), to be a reliable predictor of growth and development. Fish and fisheries researchers have yet to widely acknowledge the power of the GDD in explaining growth and development among fishes. We demonstrate that fish length-at-day (LaD), in most cases prior to maturation, is a strong linear function of the GDD metric that can explain {\textgreater}92{\%} of the variation in LaD among 41 data sets representing nine fish species drawn from marine and freshwater en- vironments, temperate and tropical climes, constant and variable temperature regimes, and laboratory and field studies. The GDD demonstrates explanatory power across large spatial scales, e.g., 93{\%} of the variation in LaD for age-2 to -4 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) across their entire range (17 stocks) is explained by one simple GDD function. Moreover, GDD can explain much of the variation in fish egg development time and in aquatic invertebrate (crab) size-at-age. Our analysis extends the well-established and physiologically relevant GDD metric to fish where, relative to conven- tional time-based methods, it provides greater explanatory power.

abstract = {The evolution of complex organisms is a puzzle for evolutionary theory because beneficial mutations should be less frequent in complex organisms, an effect termed "cost of complexity." However, little is known about how the distribution of mutation fitness effects (f(s)) varies across genomes. The main theoretical framework to address this issue is Fisher's geometric model and related phenotypic landscape models. However, it suffers from several restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we intend to show how several of these limitations may be overcome. We then propose a model of f(s) that extends Fisher's model to account for arbitrary mutational and selective interactions among n traits. We show that these interactions result in f(s) that would be predicted by a much smaller number of independent traits. We test our predictions by comparing empirical f(s) across species of various gene numbers as a surrogate to complexity. This survey reveals, as predicted, that mutations tend to be more deleterious, less variable, and less skewed in higher organisms. However, only limited difference in the shape of f(s) is observed from Escherichia coli to nematodes or fruit flies, a pattern consistent with a model of random phenotypic interactions across many traits. Overall, these results suggest that there may be a cost to phenotypic complexity although much weaker than previously suggested by earlier theoretical works. More generally, the model seems to qualitatively capture and possibly explain the variation of f(s) from lower to higher organisms, which opens a large array of potential applications in evolutionary genetics.},

abstract = {Population models are needed to assess the threats to species at risk and to evaluate alternative management actions. Data to support modeling is limited for many species at risk, and commonly used approaches generally assume stationary vital rates, a questionable assumption given widespread ecosystem change. We describe a modeling approach that can be applied to time series of length composition data to estimate vital rates and test for changes in these rates. Our approach uses stage-structured population models fit within a Bayesian state-space model. This approach simultaneously allows for both process and observation uncertainty, and it facilitates incorporating prior information on population dynamics and on the monitoring process. We apply these models to populations of winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) that have been designated as "endangered" or "threatened." These models indicate that natural mortality has decreased for juveniles and increased for adults in these populations. The declines observed in these populations had been attributed to unsustainable rates of bycatch in fisheries for other groundfishes; our analyses indicate that increased natural mortality of adults is also an important factor contributing to these declines. Adult natural mortality was positively related to grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) abundance, suggesting the hypothesis that increased adult mortality reflected increased predation by expanding grey seal herds. Population projections indicated that the threatened population would be expected to stabilize at a low level of abundance if all fishery removals were eliminated, but that the endangered population would likely continue to decline even in the absence of fishery removals. We note that time series of size distributions are available for most marine fish populations monitored by research surveys, and we suggest that a similar approach could be used to extract information from these time series in order to estimate mortality rates and changes in these rates. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of abundance are imperative for successful conservation and management. Classical, stratified abundance estimators provide unbiased estimates of abundance, but such estimators may be imprecise and impede assessment of population status and trend when the distribution of individuals is highly variable in space. Model-based procedures that account for important environmental covariates can improve overall precision, but frequently there is uncertainty about the contribution of particular environmental variables and a lack of information about variables that are important determinants of abundance. We develop a general semiparametric mixture model that incorporates measured habitat variables and a non-parametric smoothing term to account for unmeasured variables. We contrast this spatial habitat approach with two stratified abundance estimators and compare the three models using an intensively managed marine fish, darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri). We show that the spatial habitat model yields more precise, biologically reasonable, and interpretable estimates of abundance than the classical methods. Our results suggest that while design-based estimators are unbiased, they may exaggerate temporal variability of populations and strongly influence inference about population trend. Furthermore, when such estimates are used in broader meta-analyses, such imprecision may affect the broader biological inference (e.g., the causes and conse-quences of the variability of populations).

abstract = {Catchability is an important parameter in many stock assessment models because it relates an index of abundance to stock size. We review the theory and evidence for time-varying catchability, its effects on stock assessment estimates, and methods to include time-varying catchability in stock assessments. Numerous studies provide strong evidence that time- varying catchability is common inmost fisheries and many fishery-independent surveys and can be caused by anthropogenic, environmental, biological, and management processes. Trends in catchability over time can cause biased estimates of stock size and fishing mortality rates in stock assessment models that do not compensate for them. Methods that use descriptive and functional relationships have been developed to incorporate time-varying catchability in stock assessment models. We recommend that the default assumption for stock assessments should be that catchability varies over time and that multiple methods of including time-varying catchability should be applied. Additional studies are needed to determine relative performance of alternative methods and to develop methods for selecting among models.},

@article{Anderson1954,
abstract = {(1) It has been established by recent work in Palaeontology and Systematics that evolution has not proceeded at a slow even rate. There have instead been bursts of evolutionary activity as for example when large fresh water lakes (Baikal, Tanganyika, and Lanao) were created de novo. (2) Recent studies of introgression (hybridization and subsequent back-crossing) have demonstrated that under the influence of man evolution has been greatly accelerated. There has been a rapid evolution of plants and animals under domestication and an almost equally rapid evolution of weed species and strains in greatly disturbed habitats. (3) The rapidity of evolution in these bursts of creative evolution may well have been due to hybridization. At such times diverse faunas and floras were brought together in the presence of new or greatly disturbed habitats where some hybrid derivates would have been at a selective advantage. Far from being without bearing on general theories of evolution, the repeated demonstrations of accelerated introgression in disturbed habitats are of tremendous significance, showing how much more rapidly evolution can proceed under the impact of a new ecological dominant (in this case, Man). Such an agent may bring diverse faunas and floras into contact. Even more important is the creation of various new, more or less open habitats in which novel deviates of partially hybrid ancestry are at a selective advantage. The enhanced evolution which we see in our own gardens, dooryards, dumps and roadsides may well be typical of what happened during the rise of previous ecological dominants. The first vertebrates to enter isolated continents or islands, the first great herbivorous reptiles, the first herbivorous mammals must have created similar havoc upon the biotae of their own times. Introgression must have played the same predominant role in these disturbed habitats as it does today under the impact of man. These arguments are supported by a homely analogy (page 379) and by various kinds of experimental and taxonomic data.},

abstract = {The analysis of genetic similarities among marine populations is a key method for use in connectivity studies intended to provide information for management strategies. The present study aimed at assessing the con- nectivity levels of subpopulations of bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) recruits at a small scale (*200 km) among four reefs in the Mexican Caribbean. Samples were collected from 13 sites nested in two Marine Parks (Cozumel and Xcalak), one Biosphere Reserve (Chin- chorro Bank) and one unprotected area (Mahahual). A total of 713 samples were genetically characterized by means of seven microsatellite DNA markers and were analyzed on a hierarchical basis. A strong genetic structure was detected among sites with a weak but significant genetic structure among reefs, the combination of which has not been reported in previous studies. These results appear to be related to a ‘‘sweepstake-chance effect'' combined with oceanographic factors. An isolation by distance test, in addition to a hierarchical Bayesian method, revealed that neither distance among sites and reefs nor any of 10 environmental factors tested could be used to explain the genetic differences observed. The results suggest that conservation strategies for S. partitus based on local scales are likely to be effective.},

abstract = {Telemetry methods and remote sensing now make it possible to record the spatial usage of wide-ranging marine animals and the biophysical characteristics of their pelagic habitats. Furthermore, recent statistical advances mean such data can be used to test ecological hypotheses and estimate species' distributions. Black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys are highly mobile marine predators with a circumpolar breeding and foraging distribution in the southern hemisphere. Although they remain relatively abundant, increased fisheries bycatch has led to their listing as endangered by conservation bodies. We satellite-tracked 163 breeding black-browed albatrosses and eight closely-related Campbell albatrosses T. impavida from nine colonies. We then quantified habitat usage, and modeled population-level spatial distribution at spatiotemporal scales {\textgreater}50 km and 1 month, as a function of habitat accessibility, habitat preference and intra-specific competition, using mixed-effects Generalized Additive Models. During incubation, birds foraged over a wider area than in the post-brood chick-rearing period, when they are more time-constrained. Throughout breeding, the order of habitat preference of black-browed albatrosses was for neritic (0-500 m), shelf-break and upper shelf-slope (500 - 1000 m), and then oceanic ({\textgreater}1000 m) waters. Black-browed albatrosses also preferred areas with steeper ({\textgreater}3{\{}degree sign{\}}) bathymetric relief and in addition, during incubation, warmer sea surface temperatures (peak preference {\~{}}16{\{}degree sign{\}}). Although this suggests specialization in neritic habitats, incubation stage black-browed albatrosses from South Georgia also foraged extensively in oceanic waters, preferring areas with high Eddy Kinetic Energy ({\textgreater}250 cm2/s2), especially the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, a region of intense mesoscale turbulence. During chick-rearing this species, had a more southerly distribution, and following the seasonal retreat of sea ice birds from some populations utilized neritic polar waters. Campbell albatrosses showed similar bathymetric preferences but also preferred positive sea level anomalies. Black-browed albatross foraging areas were partially spatially segregated with respect to colony and region, with birds preferring locations distant from neighboring colonies, presumably in order to reduce competition between parapatric conspecifics. At the global scale, the greatest concentrations of breeding black-browed albatrosses are in southern South American neritic, shelf-break and shelf-slope waters. These regions also hold large fisheries and should therefore be a priority for introduction of bycatch mitigation measures.},

@article{Haltuch2009,
abstract = {There is strong evidence that low frequency between-year environmental variability, in addition to fishing, is able to affect fish population abundance via recruitment. However, scientific advice regarding catch limits is often based on control rules that depend on the estimation of biomass reference points which typically do not explicitly consider the effects of trends over time in reference points caused by environmental variability. Harvest rates based on commonly used biological reference points such as the level of unfished spawning biomass (B0), the current size of the stock in relation to B0, and BMSY that are sustainable under current environmental conditions may be unsustainable under different environmental conditions. Although several methods exist for estimating biomass reference points, it is unclear which of these are most robust to the effects of long term, low frequency environmental variability. Therefore, simulation is used to evaluate alternative estimators, which differ in terms of how the stock-recruitment relationship is modeled, and whether explicit estimators or proxies are used for B0, the steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship, and current spawning biomass relative to B0. The simulations consider three life histories: a long-lived unproductive rockfish, a moderately long-lived and productive flatfish, and a moderately long-lived and productive hake with highly variable recruitment. Results indicate that in the presence of low frequency autocorrelated forcing of recruitment, biomass reference points should be based on average recruitment and/or dynamic B0 if catch and survey data are available for at least one full period of the environmental variable. In contrast, previous analysis suggests that in the absence of autocorrelated environmental forcing of recruitment, and if the available catch and survey data do not span at least, in this case, 50 years which is one full period of the environmental variable, biomass reference points should be based on the fit of the stock-recruitment relationship. Life history affects the estimability of biomass reference points, which are more difficult to estimate for species with more rapid dynamics such as hake. The method used to calculate the reference points given the results of a stock assessment has a larger effect on estimability than the configuration of the stock assessment method, for the three stock assessment model configurations investigated in this study.},

We address a long-standing controversy and paradox about the contribution of non-additive genetic variation, namely that knowledge about biological pathways and gene networks imply that epistasis is important. Yet empirical data across a range of traits and species imply that most genetic variance is additive. We evaluate the evidence from empirical studies of genetic variance components and find that additive variance typically accounts for over half, and often close to 100{\%}, of the total genetic variance. We present new theoretical results, based upon the distribution of allele frequencies under neutral and other population genetic models, that show why this is the case even if there are non-additive effects at the level of gene action. We conclude that interactions at the level of genes are not likely to generate much interaction at the level of variance.},

abstract = {Geostatistical methods were used to (i) quantify fish aggregation patterns over a range of scales (100 m to 67 km) using both simulated and acoustic density data of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and (ii) examine how changes in aggregation patterns influenced the precision of geostatistical density indices. Variogram parameters (range, sill, and nugget) reflected changes in distribution patterns. Variograms of dispersed and low-density aggregations had large range and small sill and nugget values. In contrast, when fish were aggregated in a small portion of the study area, the range was low and the sill and nugget large. The precision of density indices (coefficient of variation) was below 20{\%} in all cases but at a maximum during summer when cod were broadly distributed in small, moderate to dense aggregations. Geostatistical modeling allowed us to describe and quantify distribution patterns of fish density over different scales of observation, comparisons of spatiotemporal changes in density distribution, and estimations of the precision of density indices while accounting for the effects of heterogeneous distributions, outliers and the typically large number of zero and low-density observations. Geostatistical methods have particular applicability to fishes exhibiting gregarious behaviour and seasonally variable distributions, which include many temperate and high-latitude fish species. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC.},

abstract = {Time-varying selectivity is one of the main challenges in single species age-based assessment models. In classical deterministic VPA-type models the fishing mortality rates are unfiltered representations of the observed catches. As a consequence the selectivity becomes time-varying, but this representation is too fluctuating, because it includes the observation noise. In parametric statistical catch at age models a common assumption is that the selectivity is constant in all years, although time-varying selectivity can be introduced by splitting the data period in blocks with different selectivities, or by using smoothing splines and penalized time-deviances. However, these methods require subjective choices w.r.t. the degree of time-varying allowed. A simple state-space assessment model is presented as an alternative, which among other benefits offers an objective way of estimating time-varying selectivity pattern. The fishing mortality rates are considered (possibly correlated) stochastic processes, and the corresponding process variances are estimated within the model. The model is applied to North Sea cod and it is verified from simulations that time-varying selectivity can be estimated. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The principle of intergenerational equity, one of the main tenets of the Precautionary Approach, and the principle of sustainable utilization both imply that the Precautionary Approach should explicitly incorporate the protection of fishing communities, not only the resources they depend on. Risk assessment aims primarily at evaluating the consequences of various harvest strategies in terms of probabilistic statements about future trends in yields, biomass, and dangers to the stock, while risk management involves finding and implementing management policies, strategies, and tactics that reduce the risk to the communities exploiting them. Not all fishery management approaches deal equally well with risk, with some compounding rather than reducing risk. Portfolio management, whereby fishing enterprises have the ability to choose among a diverse portfolio of harvestable resources, would mitigate against the risk of fluctuations in the abundance, availability, or price of individual species. Although much remains to be achieved in better assessing risk, fishery management agencies should immediately implement risk management.},

We explore a number of pharmacokinetic models which are known to be non-identifiable at an individual level but can become identifiable at the population level if a number of specific assumptions on the probabilistic model hold. Essentially if the probabilistic models are different, even though the structural models are non-identifiable, then they will lead to different likelihoods.

abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector and continues to expand alongside terrestrial crop and livestock production. Using portfolio theory as a conceptual framework, we explore how current interconnections between the aquaculture, crop, livestock, and fisheries sectors act as an impediment to, or an opportunity for, enhanced resilience in the global food system given increased resource scarcity and climate change. Aquaculture can potentially enhance resilience through improved resource use efficiencies and increased diversification of farmed species, locales of production, and feeding strategies. However, aquaculture's reliance on terrestrial crops and wild fish for feeds, its dependence on freshwater and land for culture sites, and its broad array of environmental impacts diminishes its ability to add resilience. Feeds for livestock and farmed fish that are fed rely largely on the same crops, although the fraction destined for aquaculture is presently small (∼4{\%}). As demand for high-value fed aquaculture products grows, competition for these crops will also rise, as will the demand for wild fish as feed inputs. Many of these crops and forage fish are also consumed directly by humans and provide essential nutrition for low-income households. Their rising use in aquafeeds has the potential to increase price levels and volatility, worsening food insecurity among the most vulnerable populations. Although the diversification of global food production systems that includes aquaculture offers promise for enhanced resilience, such promise will not be realized if government policies fail to provide adequate incentives for resource efficiency, equity, and environmental protection.},

abstract = {Identifying the existence and magnitude of density dependence is one of the oldest concerns in ecology. Ecologists have aimed to estimate density dependence in population and community data by fitting a simple autoregressive (Gompertz) model for density dependence to time series of abundance for an entire population. However, it is increasingly recognized that spatial heterogeneity in population densities has implications for population and community dynamics. We therefore adapt the Gompertz model to approximate local densities over continuous space instead of population-wide abundance, and allow productivity to vary spatially using Gaussian random fields. We then show that the conventional (nonspatial) Gompertz model can result in biased estimates of density dependence (e.g., identifying oscillatory dynamics when not present) if densities vary spatially. By contrast, the spatial Gompertz model provides accurate and precise estimates of density dependence for a variety of simulation scenarios and data availabilities. These results are corroborated when comparing spatial and nonspatial models for data from 10 years and; 100 sampling stations for three long-lived rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the California, USA coast. In this case, the nonspatial model estimates implausible oscillatory dynamics on an annual time scale, while the spatial model estimates strong autocorrelation and is supported by model selection tools. We conclude by discussing the importance of improved data archiving techniques, so that spatial models can be used to reexamine classic questions regarding the existence and magnitude of density dependence in wild populations. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Many important ecological questions require accounting for spatial variation in demographic rates (e.g., survival) and population variables (e.g., abundance per unit area). However, ecologists have few spatial modelling approaches that (i) fit directly to spatially referenced data, (ii) represent population dynamics explicitly and mechanistically, and (iii) estimate parameters using rigorous statistical methods. We therefore demonstrate a new and computationally efficient approach to spatial modelling that uses random fields in place of the random variables typically used in spatially aggregated models. We adapt this approach to delay-difference dynamics to estimate the impact of fishing and natural mortality, recruitment, and individual growth on spatial population dynamics for a fish population. In particular, we develop this approach to estimate spatial variation in average production of juvenile fishes (termed recruitment), as well as annual variation in the spatial distribution of recruitment. We first use a simulation experiment to demonstrate that the spatial delay-difference model can, in some cases, explain over 50{\%} of spatial variance in recruitment. We also apply the spatial delay-difference model to data for rex sole (Glyptocephalus zachirus) in the Gulf of Alaska and show that average recruitment (across all years) is greatest near Kodiak Island but that some years show greatest recruitment in Southeast Alaska or the western Gulf of Alaska. Using model developments and software advances presented here, we argue that future research can develop models to approximate adult movement, incorporate spatial covariates to explain annual variation in recruitment, and evaluate management procedures that use spatially explicit estimates of population abundance.},

abstract = {Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts of wild and hatchery origins (n = 522) were tagged with ultrasonic transmitters and monitored at successive arrays of submerged receivers during migration from five watersheds in three regions of the Bay of Fundy (BoF), Canada. Two of the regions had endangered inner BoF salmon populations. Migration success of postsmolts leaving the BoF varied widely among 13 groups monitored (3{\%}-70{\%}) and was influenced by behaviour and passage time. Region of origin was the key variable in habitat-specific survival models selected using the Akaike information criterion. Rearing origin, migration and release timing, and smolt size were important variables in some habitats. Estimated survival rates (overall and habitat specific) differed markedly among salmon populations of different regions. Mediocre estuarine survival of smolts (0.54) from the outer BoF region affected overall survival (0.66), Poor survival (0.21) in coastal areas of the distant inner BoF region and mediocre survival in other habitats resulted in low overall survival (0.06) that severely limited the potential for population recovery. Potential predators were abundant in habitats where survival was lowest. High survival of salmon from the intermediate inner BoF region in all habitats (0.81-0.93) was not responsible for their failure to return.},

developed a surplus production model considering seasonal movements

We predicted future biomass by using CPUE data from coastal gill-net
fishing and offshore bottom trawl fishing in 2000 to 2009. The model
reflected the seasonal coastal-offshore movements of Sea Ravens well,
and it predicted increasing Sea Raven biomass in both areas, which was
validated by the CPUEs observed after 2010-including those for trial
bottom trawl fishing that occurred within limited offshore areas after
the accident. Our results indicate that the newly developed model
incorporating seasonal movements of Sea Ravens is feasible and that the
waters off Fukushima have effectively been serving as an MPA since the
nuclear accident. We also demonstrated the model's applicability for
estimating the optimal fishing effort and designing a newMPA for

abstract = {An age-structured, spatial survey-based assessment model (SSURBA) is developed and applied to the Grand Banks stock (NAFO Divisions 3LNO) of American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) in Newfoundland and Labrador. The state-space model is fit to annual spatial (i.e., three divisions) stock size-at-age research vessel (RV) survey indices that are assumed to be proportional to abundance. We model index catchability (q) as a logistic function of fish length, which varies with age, cohort, and the time of the survey; therefore, the model facilitates the estimation of q values that change spatially and temporally following changes in fish growth and survey gears. The SSURBA model produces division-level estimates of fishing mortality rates (F), stock productivity, and stock size relative to the logistic catchability assumption with q=1 for fully selected ages. The spatial model allows us to include additional survey information compared with the space-aggregated assessment model (all of 3LNO) that is currently used to assess stock status. The model can provide estimates of relative catch, which we compare with reported catch trends to partially validate the model.},

We show that the opportunity for selection (variance in relative fitness) places an upper bound on the amount that the mean of any character can be shifted by directional selection. Second, we offer several solutions to the problem of analyzing multiple selection episodes (e.g., sexual versus natural selection). We show how the total effect of directional selection can be partitioned into parts corresponding to particular selection episodes or fitness components. The opportunity for selection cannot be so readily partitioned because of covariances between fitness components. We present a rather complex partitioning which may nevertheless be useful in particular applications.},

abstract = {The recent, rapid development of fishing in Mauritania offers a good case study for a comparative approach of the resilience of the species exploited there, in the face of increasing fishing pressure. First, we assessed the health of 22 demersal stocks with differing ecological requirements, demographic strategies, and states of exploitation. A dynamic production model was fitted in a framework of Bayesian statistics to abundance indices estimated from scientific trawl surveys or commercial catch per unit efforts. We show that 12 of the 22 stocks assessed are overexploited and 3 are fully exploited. The combined assessment of all 22 stocks demonstrates an overall overexploitation, with total demersal biomass decreasing by 75{\%} since 1982 and fishing effort 30{\%} higher than that at maximum sustained yield (40{\%} higher for finfish). Second, relations between states of stocks and life history traits were analysed. The stocks of large and vulnerable species currently undergo the highest fishing pressure and are those that are the most overexploited. At the scale of the community represented by the stocks considered, surveys-based indictors of the mean intrinsic vulnerability, the mean maximum length, and the mean trophic level exhibit a significant decrease from 1990 to 2010. Changes observed in catch-based indicators depend on fishing strategies and are impacted by the recent development of the small-scale fishery. But indicators expressed as a function of a multiplier of fishing effort or fishing mortality clearly decrease, thus confirming that the intensification of exploitation leads to communities dominated by smaller species and lower trophic levels. Weconclude that large and high trophic level species, such as white grouper, meagre, guitarfish, and smooth-hound, are markers of ecosystem health and should be considered as sentinel species.},

@article{Dormann2007,
abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

We resolve this by presenting modifications of existing network metrics, and developing entirely new metrics, that account for node self-con- nections. Then, we illustrate the performance of these new and modified metrics with an age-struc- tured metapopulation model for a real-world marine reserve network case study, and we evaluate the robustness of our findings by systematically varying particular features of that network. Our new and modified metrics predict metapopulation persistence much better than existing metrics do, even when self-connections are weak. Existing metrics become good predictors of persistence only when self-connections are entirely absent, an unrealistic scenario in the overwhelming major- ity of metapopulation applications. Our study provides a set of novel tools that can substantially enhance the extent to which network metrics can be employed to understand, and manage for, metapopulation persistence.},

abstract = {Models for marine reserve design have been developed primarily with 'reef fish' life histories in mind: sedentary adults in patches connected by larval dispersal. However, many fished species undertake ontogenetic migrations, such as from nursery grounds to adult spawning habitats, and current theory does not fully address the range of reserve options posed by that situation. I modelled a generic species with ontogenetic migration to investigate the possible benefits of reserves under three alternative scenarios. First, the fishery targets adult habitat, and reserves can sustain yields under high exploitation, unless habitat patches are well connected. Second, the fishery targets the nursery, and reserves are highly effective, regardless of connectivity patterns. Third, the fishery targets both habitats, and reserves only succeed if paired on adjacent, well-connected nursery and adult patches. In all cases, reserves can buffer populations against overexploitation but would not enhance fishery yield beyond that achievable by management without reserves. These results summarize the general situations in which management using reserves could be useful for ontogenetically migrating species, and the type of connectivity data needed to inform reserve design.},

abstract = {Standardization of catch per unit effort is an effective way to not only extract temporal abundance trends but also understand distribution shifts of fish resources. Chub mackerel in the Northwest Pacific has recently been of great concern to fishermen and fisheries managers because the total catch has been increasing, and fishing grounds have expanded from the Japanese exclusive economic zone eastward to high-sea areas. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of chub mackerel is urgently needed for evaluating the current status (i.e., abundance and distribution) and considering future exploitation. Here we constructed two recruitment indices from pelagic trawl survey data of the Pacific chub mackerel. For recruitment indices of age-0 fish, we integrated an algorithm for automatic area stratification into the delta-GLM that combines two separate generalized linear models (for encounter probability and positive catch rates) to simultaneously investigate changes in relative abundance and distribution. Recruitment indices were high in the recent years of 2013, 2016, and 2017, especially at around 160 °E longitude within the high-sea areas, suggesting simultaneous changes in abundance and distribution. Furthermore, we found that our approach had better predictive ability, especially for positive catch rates, than that of a generalized additive model by cross validation, and the obtained standardized indices mitigated potential bias in stock assessment estimates. Our integrated approach will be useful for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of fishes and standardizing abundance indices for stock assessment and management.},

This enables error in the catch process to be reflected in the uncertainty of estimated model parameters and management quantities. Benefits of the continuous-time state-space model formulation include the ability to provide estimates of exploitable biomass and fishing mortality at any point in time from data sampled at arbitrary and possibly irregular intervals. We show in a simulation that the ability to analyse subannual data can increase the effective sample size and improve estimation of reference points relative to discrete-time analysis of aggregated annual data. Finally, subannual data from five North Sea stocks are analysed with particular focus on using residual analysis to diagnose model insufficiencies and identify necessary model extensions such as robust estimation and incorporation of seasonality. We argue that including all known sources of uncertainty, propagation of that uncertainty to reference points and checking of model assumptions using residuals are critical prerequisites to rigorous fish stock management based on surplus production models.},

The populations collectively define the BoF Striped Bass Designatable Unit (DU). The DU has been assessed as ‘at risk' by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) on two occasions, the first in 2004 as Threatened and the second in 2012 as Endangered. Declining demographic status resulting from loss of spawning populations and unmitigated threats to extant spawning populations were the most significant factors contributing to the ‘at risk' designations. The BoF Striped Bass DU is presently under consideration for listing as Endangered on Schedule 1 of Canada's Species at Risk Act (SARA). A Recovery Potential Assessment completed in 2006 in response to the Threatened designation is, therefore, in need of an update. The aim of this document is to synthesize and to update where possible information relevant to the Recovery Potential Assessment. The information is presented both for the individual spawning populations that define the DU and for the DU as a whole.},

Biologists have consequently long been interested in decomposing change measured at the population level into contributions from individuals, the traits they express and the alleles they carry. We present a novel method of estimating individual contributions to population growth and changes in distributions of quantitative traits and alleles. An individual's contribution to population growth is an individual's realized annual fitness. We demonstrate how the quantities we develop can be used to address a range of empirical questions, and provide an application to a detailed dataset of Soay sheep. The approach provides results that are consistent with those obtained using lifetime estimates of individual performance, yet is substantially more powerful as it allows lifetime performance to be decomposed into annual survival and fecundity contributions.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for the analysis of groundfish survey data by incorporating zero and non-zero values into a single model. This is done by using a model which modifies the delta-distribution approach to fit into the GLM framework and uses maximum likelihood to estimate parameters. No prior assumptions of homogeneity are used for the structure of the zero or non-zero values. The method is primarily applicable to fixed-station designs, although extensions to other designs are possible. The maximum likelihood estimation reduces to fitting a GLM to 0/1 values and another GLM to the positive abundance values. The new model is tested on Icelandic groundfish survey data. It is seen that the model can be used for evaluating the effect of different factors on catch rates as well as estimating abundance indices. Results from different models are compared on the basis of tuned VPA runs. {\textcopyright} 1996 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {Multispecies models are widely used to evaluate management trade-offs arising from species interactions. However, identifying climate impacts and sensitive habitats requires integrating spatial heterogeneity and environmental impacts into multispecies models at fine spatial scales. We therefore develop a spatio-temporal model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments (a “MICE-in-space”), which is fitted to survey sampling data and time series of fishing mortality using maximum-likelihood techniques. The model is implemented in the VAST R package, and it can be configured to range from purely descriptive to including ratio-dependent interactions among species. We demonstrate this model using data for four groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska using data from 1982 to 2015. Model selection for this case-study shows that models with species interactions are parsimonious, although a model specifying separate density dependence without interactions also has substantial support. The AIC-selected model estimates a significant, negative impact of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) on productivity of other species and suggests that recent fishing mortality for Pacific cod (G. microcephalus, Gadidae) is above the biological reference point (BRP) resulting in 40{\%} of unfished biomass; other models show similar trends but different scales due to different BRP estimates. A simulation experiment shows that fitting a model with fewer species at a coarse spatial resolution degrades estimation performance, but that interactions and biological reference points can still be estimated accurately. We conclude that MICE-in-space models can simultaneously estimate fishing impacts, species trade-offs, biological reference points and habitat quality. They are therefore suitable to forecast short-term climate impacts, optimize survey designs and designate protected habitats.},

We explore whether a resilience perspective (i.e., a different paradigm for understanding populations, communities, and ecosystems) is a viable alternative framework for anadromous fish restoration. Many life history traits have allowed anadromous fish to thrive in unimpacted ecosystems but have become contemporary curses as anthropogenic effects increase. This contradiction creates a significant conservation challenge but also makes these fish excellent candidates for a resilience approach. A resilience approach recognizes the need to maintain life history, population, and habitat characteristics that increase the ability of a population to withstand and recover from multiple disturbances. To evaluate whether a resilience approach represents a viable strategy for anadromous fish restoration, we review four issues: (1) how resilience theory can inform anadromous fish restoration, (2) how a resilience-based approach is fundamentally different than extant anadromous fish restoration strategies, (3) ecological characteristics that historically benefited anadromous fish persistence, and (4) examples of how human impacts harm anadromous fish and how a resilience approach might produce more successful outcomes. We close by suggesting new research and restoration directions for implementation of a resilience-based approach.},

However, identifying adaptive radiations has proven difficult due to a lack of broad-scale comparative datasets. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative data on body size and shape in a diversity of animal clades to test a key model of adaptive radiation, in which initially rapid morphological evolution is followed by relative stasis. We compared the fit of this model to both single selective peak and random walk models. We found little support for the early-burst model of adaptive radiation, whereas both other models, particularly that of selective peaks, were commonly supported. In addition, we found that the net rate of morphological evolution varied inversely with clade age. The youngest clades appear to evolve most rapidly because long-term change typically does not attain the amount of divergence predicted from rates measured over short time scales. Across our entire analysis, the dominant pattern was one of constraints shaping evolution continually through time rather than rapid evolution followed by stasis. We suggest that the classical model of adaptive radiation, where morphological evolution is initially rapid and slows through time, may be rare in comparative data.},

abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the ‘areas-as-fleets' approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the “integrated approach” to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

abstract = {The inclusion of unwanted targets in hydroacoustic surveys biases estimates of fish abundance. Thus, knowledge of frequency-dependent responses of unwanted targets (e.g., pelagic macroinvertebrates) can help ensure that transducer frequencies are used that minimize this bias. We determined how fish density estimates varied across multiple frequencies when the larval stage of a midge, Chaoborus, was present in the water column. We hypothesized that fish density estimates would increase with increasing transducer frequency, owing to greater backscattering by Chaoborus at higher frequencies than lower ones, which allows it to be included with the backscattering caused by fish. We found that fish density estimates were always greater at higher frequencies (e.g., 120 and 200 kHz) compared to a lower one (70 kHz) in several productive north-temperate reservoirs. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons of total (i.e., fish plus Chaoborus) backscattering showed that significantly more backscattering occurred at higher rather than lower frequencies. We also found that fish density estimates varied between spring and summer, partially owing to inter-seasonal size variation in Chaoborus that influenced its backscattering. Beyond demonstrating why the presence of pelagic macroinvertebrates needs to be considered when estimating fish abundance with hydroacoustics, we provide methods to identify and reduce this bias.},

abstract = {Conventional sex roles imply caring females and competitive males. The evolution of sex role divergence is widely attributed to anisogamy initiating a self-reinforcing process. The initial asymmetry in pre-mating parental investment (eggs vs. sperm) is assumed to promote even greater divergence in post-mating parental investment (parental care). But do we really understand the process? Trivers [Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man 1871-1971 (1972), Aldine Press, Chicago] introduced two arguments with a female and male perspective on whether to care for offspring that try to link pre-mating and post-mating investment. Here we review their merits and subsequent theoretical developments. The first argument is that females are more committed than males to providing care because they stand to lose a greater initial investment. This, however, commits the 'Concorde Fallacy' as optimal decisions should depend on future pay-offs not past costs. Although the argument can be rephrased in terms of residual reproductive value when past investment affects future pay-offs, it remains weak. The factors likely to change future pay-offs seem to work against females providing more care than males. The second argument takes the reasonable premise that anisogamy produces a male-biased operational sex ratio (OSR) leading to males competing for mates. Male care is then predicted to be less likely to evolve as it consumes resources that could otherwise be used to increase competitiveness. However, given each offspring has precisely two genetic parents (the Fisher condition), a biased OSR generates frequency-dependent selection, analogous to Fisherian sex ratio selection, that favours increased parental investment by whichever sex faces more intense competition. Sex role divergence is therefore still an evolutionary conundrum. Here we review some possible solutions. Factors that promote conventional sex roles are sexual selection on males (but non-random variance in male mating success must be high to override the Fisher condition), loss of paternity because of female multiple mating or group spawning and patterns of mortality that generate female-biased adult sex ratios (ASR). We present an integrative model that shows how these factors interact to generate sex roles. We emphasize the need to distinguish between the ASR and the operational sex ratio (OSR). If mortality is higher when caring than competing this diminishes the likelihood of sex role divergence because this strongly limits the mating success of the earlier deserting sex. We illustrate this in a model where a change in relative mortality rates while caring and competing generates a shift from a mammalian type breeding system (female-only care, male-biased OSR and female-biased ASR) to an avian type system (biparental care and a male-biased OSR and ASR).},

By comparison, prey capture rate in the light (20 lx) among 8-13-dph larvae that were offered 50 prey/L was about fourfold higher than the capture rate for nonvisual feeding; however, at 800 prey/L, capture rates in lighted conditions and in darkness were similar. Among larvae with noninflated swim bladders, prey capture in the dark was severely inhibited. {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2012.},

abstract = {Aim: Species distribution modelling, a family of statistical methods that predicts species distributions from a set of occurrences and environmental predictors, is now routinely applied in many macroecological studies. However, the reliability of evaluation metrics usually employed to validate these models remains questioned. Moreover, the emergence of online databases of environmental variables with global coverage, especially climatic, has favoured the use of the same set of standard predictors. Unfortunately, the selection of variables is too rarely based on a careful examination of the species' ecology. In this context, our aim was to highlight the importance of selecting ad hoc variables in species distribution models, and to assess the ability of classical evaluation statistics to identify models with no biological realism. Innovation: First, we reviewed the current practices in the field of species distribution modelling in terms of variable selection and model evaluation. Then, we computed distribution models of 509 European species using pseudo-predictors derived from paintings or using a real set of climatic and topographic predictors. We calculated model performance based on the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS), partitioning occurrences into training and test data with different levels of spatial independence. Most models computed from pseudo-predictors were classified as good and sometimes were even better evaluated than models computed using real environmental variables. However, on average they were better discriminated when the partitioning of occurrences allowed testing for model transferability. Main conclusions: These findings confirm the crucial importance of variable selection and the inability of current evaluation metrics to assess the biological significance of distribution models. We recommend that researchers carefully select variables according to the species' ecology and evaluate models only according to their capacity to be transfered in distant areas. Nevertheless, statistics of model evaluations must still be interpreted with great caution.},

Larvae were distributed throughout the water column, although at some locations pronounced peaks in concentration associated with the thermocline occurred at depths between 5 and 20 m. Vertical stratification by size occurred, but was not consistent between stations. The horizontal distribution of larvae was compared with the distribution of commercial sea scallops (potential spawners) and the residual circulation pattern. Mean larval number per m2 was usually highest in the Outer Bay, where the greatest biomass of potential spawners was found. Some transport of larvae in the direction of the residual Currents is indicated by changes in length frequency distribution. Sea scallop larvae found in the Bay of Fundy appear to originate there, rather than from the Gulf of Maine, or the Scotian Shelf.},

abstract = {The majority of catch per unit effort (cpue) standardizations use generalized linear models (GLMs) or generalized additive models (GAMs). We develop geostatistical models that model catch locations as continuous Gaussian random fields (GRFs) and apply them to standardizing cpue in Australia's Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF). The results are compared with the traditional GLMs currently used in ETBF assessments as well as GAMs. Specifically, we compare seven models in three groups: two GLMs, two GAMs, and three GRF models. Within each group, one model treats spatial and temporal variables independently, while the other model(s) treats them together as an interaction term. The two spatio-temporal GRF models differ in treating the spatial-temporal interaction: either as a random process or as an autoregressive process. We simulate catch rate data for five pelagic species based on real fishery catch rates so that the simulated data reflect real fishery patterns while the "true" annual abundance levels are known. The results show that within each group, the model with a spatial-temporal interaction term significantly outperforms the other model treating spatial and temporal variables independently. For spatial-temporal models between the three groups, prediction accuracy tends to improve from GLM to GAM and to the GRF models. Overall, the spatio-temporal GRF autoregressive model reduces mean relative predictive error by 43.4{\%} from the GLM, 33.9{\%} from the GAM, and reduces mean absolute predictive error by 23.5{\%} from the GLM and 3.3{\%} from the GAM, respectively. The comparison suggests a promising direction for further developing the geostatistical models for the ETBF.},

Kareius bicoloratus (Basilewsky) larvae and juveniles from the stomach contents of sand shrimp, Crangon affinis (De Haan). We succeeded in isolating stone flounder DNA from the stomach contents of sand shrimp, using a cell lysis buffer containing 8 M urea. DNA for PCR analysis was obtained from stomach contents even when it was isolated 5 hours after the termination of predation. However, the total DNA yield decreased as the time after predation progressed. Stone flounder was distinguished from other prey in the stomach contents of sand shrimp using PCR with universal primers for fish and restriction analysis of mtDNA. Successful amplification of stone flounder mtDNA was possible up until 4 h after the termination of predation, but no amplification was possible 5 h after the termination of predation. In addition, a part of the D-loop region of stone flounder mtDNA was cloned, sequenced, and used to design species-specific PCR primers that allow amplification for stone flounder. PCR products were not obtained from the total DNA of other possible prey of the sand shrimp: 11 fish species; 2 mysid species; one amphipod species; and 2 polychaete species. In this paper, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the PCR method coupled with restriction analysis, and the species-specific PCR method to identify consumed larval and juvenile fish species in the guts of predators.},

Because many islands are young and have relatively few species, evolutionary adaptation and species proliferation are obvious and easy to study.

For these reasons, island research provides valuable insights into speciation and adaptive radiation, and into the relative importance of contingency and determinism in evolutionary diversification.},

abstract = {In addition to fostering biodiversity goals, marine protected area (MPA) implementation has economic consequences for both commercial and recreational fisheries. During the implementation of the State of California (USA) Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA), which mandates the creation of an MPA network in California's state waters, the stakeholders and policymakers utilized a pair of economic analyses that addressed these considerations. One was a comparative, static assessment of short-term, " worst case" potential socioeconomic impacts to important fisheries based on surveys of local fishermen. This analysis made no assumptions about fishery management outside of MPAs, assumed no spillover of fish from MPAs into fished areas or reallocation of fishing effort, and estimated the maximum potential dollar-value economic impacts over a short time scale. The other was a dynamic, bioeconomic assessment of the changes in spatial distribution of biomass and catch, based on published biological parameter values, oceanographic models of larval connectivity, and a range of possible levels of fishing. This analysis explicitly accounted for fish population dynamics, spillover, fisher movement, and fishery management outside of the MPAs, but was limited to long-term, equilibrium-based results because of a lack of baseline abundance data. Both evaluation methods were novel in their spatial resolution and their use directly in an MPA design process, rather than after implementation. The two methods produced broadly similar (at a regional spatial scale) evaluations of the likely effects of proposed MPAs on fisheries, at least when the bioeconomic model assumed fishery management was conservative. Our experience with these analyses in the MLPA Initiative process led to several suggestions for future MPA design efforts: (i) since the change in fish biomass inside MPAs partly depends on fisheries management outside of them, it is useful to integrate or coordinate conventional fishery management and MPA planning efforts; (ii) integrate modeling assessments early into MPA design, as part of a post-implementation adaptive management approach; and (iii) integrate empirical fishery data into bioeconomic models in order to improve representations of human behavior and short-term forecasts of changes in fished populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite being one of the most common pieces of information used in assessing the status of fish stocks, relative abundance indices based on catch per unit effort (cpue) data are notoriously problematic. Raw cpue is seldom proportional to abundance over a whole exploitation history and an entire geographic range, because numerous factors affect catch rates. One of the most commonly applied fisheries analyses is standardization of cpue data to remove the effect of factors that bias cpue as an index of abundance. Even if cpue is standardized appropriately, the resulting index of relative abundance, in isolation, provides limited information for management advice or about the effect of fishing. In addition, cpue data generally cannot provide information needed to assess and manage communities or ecosystems. We discuss some of the problems associated with the use of cpue data and some methods to assess and provide management advice about fish populations that can help overcome these problems, including integrated stock assessment models, management strategy evaluation, and adaptive management. We also discuss the inappropriateness of using cpue data to evaluate the status of communities. We use tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean as examples. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

In clinical practice, the diagnostic yield of blood cultures and other investigations which aim to identify a causative organism or site of infection is low. We have retrospectively examined all blood cultures collected in a "real world" cohort of patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia and patients with aggressive lymphoma treated with Hyper-CVAD/MTX-cytarabine, at a single tertiary center over a five-year period. In this cohort, the 30-day mortality following confirmed blood stream infection (BSI) was 5.9{\%}, which is lower than most reports in the recent literature. We compared the blood culture results of inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy and outpatients presenting with fevers and found a significantly higher rate of proven BSI in the outpatient group. In all settings, gram-negative organisms were most common. The rate of resistance to first-line empiric antibiotics among pathogenic isolates was 11.6{\%} in the whole cohort, independent of blood culture circumstances. There was a trend to higher resistance rates among inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy compared to patients presenting to the emergency department (17.4{\%} vs 7.5{\%}) but this did not reach statistical significance. We also report low rates of ciprofloxacin resistance (5{\%} of isolates), in a center where universal fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is not employed. Our low resistance and mortality rates support our current therapeutic strategies, however presence of resistant organisms across the spectrum of indications for BC collection highlights the importance of surveilling local patterns, escalating antimicrobial therapy in the deteriorating patient, and considering advanced techniques for the rapid identification of resistance in this patient population.},

We then apply those principles to four cases in which large parts of marine ecosystems are being managed, and ask how including additional components of an EBM approach might improve the prospects for those ecosystems. The case studies provide examples of how additional elements of EBM approaches, if applied, could improve ecosystem function. In particular, two promising next steps for applying EBM are to identify management objectives for the ecosystem, including natural and human goals, and to ensure that the governance structure matches with the scale over which ecosystem elements are measured and managed. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Biological Sciences.},

abstract = {Transport to and retention of early-life history stages within the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) region may be an important component of recruitment success of the anadromous striped bass Morone saxatilis and the white perch M. americana. This hypothesis was evaluated with spatially resolved surveys of the physical and biological characteristics of the upper Chesapeake Bay estuary during 5 cruises, 3 in May 1998 and 2 in May 1999. Gradients in depth-specific patterns of larval abundance and zooplankton prey were evaluated with respect to salinity, temperature and total suspended solids (TSS). Although physical conditions in the upper estuary differed between cruises and years, the spatial patterns in distribution of larvae and potential prey were consistent and tracked changes in salt front and ETM locations. A statistical analysis suggested that location relative to the ETM explained a significant amount of variability in concentrations of eggs, yolk-sac larvae, and larval prey, and that prey concentrations accounted for a significant amount of variability in concentrations of feeding larvae. Transport to the ETM region probably occurs during the egg (striped bass) and yolk-sac larva (white perch) stages and results in retention of early-stage feeding larvae in a zone of high prey concentrations. Physical conditions in the ETM region differed markedly between a low freshwater-flow year (1999) and a high flow year (1998), and abundances of striped bass and white perch post-yolk-sac larvae were significantly lower in 1999. Recruitment variability was poorly correlated with spawning stock biomass, but spawner-recruitment models that incorporated spring freshwater discharge explained an additional 41{\%} (striped bass) and 30{\%} (white perch) of the variability in recruitment. Annual changes in freshwater flow could control larval survival and recruitment by modifying the physical and biological characteristics of the ETM region.},

abstract = {Sex ratios in 35 inflorescence and plant counts ofperenthal, sexually dimorphic Umbelliferae vary from 096 to 8733 times as many males as females. The ranges of ratios are similar in dioecious and gynodioecious populations. In 10 populations in which both the inflorescences and plants were counted, the male/female ratios are approximately one in populations in which the plants produce only one inflorescence per year and increase as the average number of inflorescences increases. The interpretation offered is that the sex ratio is approximately one until reproduction begins, and in subsequent years increasingly malebiased ratios develop because sexual reproduction utilises more of the available resources of females than of males. Following reproduction, male plants survive longer and grow more and so become predominant. In dioecious Angiosperms generally, male-biased ratios are characteristic of long-lived repeatedly flowering species and may be partly due to differential post-reproductive growth. It is postulated that male preponderance is not directly selected for, but is a secondary consequence of separate competition among males and among fema'es during sexual reproduction. The seed set and fitness of total populations may actually decrease with the development of marked male preponderance.},

abstract = {Understanding patterns of dispersal and connectivity among marine populations can directly inform fisheries conservation and management. Advances in high-throughput sequencing offer new opportunities for estimating marine connectivity. We used restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing to examine dispersal and realized connectivity in the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus, an economically important marine bivalve. Based on 245 individuals sampled rangewide at 12 locations from Newfoundland to the Mid-Atlantic Bight, we identified and genotyped 7163 single nucleotide polymorphisms; 112 (1.6{\%}) were identified as outliers potentially under directional selection. Bayesian clustering revealed a discontinuity between northern and southern samples, and latitudinal clines in allele frequencies were observed in 42.9{\%} of the outlier loci and in 24.6{\%} of neutral loci. Dispersal estimates derived using these clines and estimates of linkage disequilibrium imply limited dispersal; 373.1 ± 407.0 km (mean ± SD) for outlier loci and 641.0 ± 544.6 km (mean ± SD) for neutral loci. Our analysis suggests restricted dispersal compared to the species range ({\textgreater}2000 km) and that dispersal and effective connectivity differ. These observations support the hypothesis that limited effective dispersal structures scallop populations along eastern North America. These findings can help refine the appropriate scale of management and conservation in this commercially valuable species.},

Then we review a selected number of case-studies implementing the discussed techniques. We conclude by proposing new areas of statistical and ecological research to further our understanding of how fish distribute and survive in space. This review serves a dual purpose by emphasizing the scientific importance of studying spatial interactions to better understand the temporal dynamics of fish abundance, and by promoting the development of new analytical and ecological approaches for the analysis of spatial data. Through our survey we cover different statistical techniques, marine ecosystems and life stages. This analytical, geographic and ontogenetic variety is also purposely selected to highlight the importance of comparative and multidisciplinary studies across diverging ecological disciplines, ecosystems and life stages. Besides having a general ecological relevance this review also bears a more applied significance, owing to the increasing need for protecting renewable marine resources along with their primary habitat. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Lopez-Maury2008,
abstract = {Malnutrition is a major factor affecting animal health, resistance to disease and survival. In honey bees (Apis mellifera), pollen, which is the main dietary source of proteins, amino acids and lipids, is essential to adult bee physiological development while reducing their susceptibility to parasites and pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pollen's nutritive impact on honey bee health remained to be determined. For that purpose, we investigated the influence of pollen nutrients on the transcriptome of worker bees parasitized by the mite Varroa destructor, known for suppressing immunity and decreasing lifespan. The 4 experimental groups (control bees without a pollen diet, control bees fed with pollen, varroa-parasitized bees without a pollen diet and varroa-parasitized bees fed with pollen) were analyzed by performing a digital gene expression (DGE) analysis on bee abdomens. Around 36, 000 unique tags were generated per DGE-tag library, which matched about 8, 000 genes (60{\%} of the genes in the honey bee genome). Comparing the transcriptome of bees fed with pollen and sugar and bees restricted to a sugar diet, we found that pollen activates nutrient-sensing and metabolic pathways. In addition, those nutrients had a positive influence on genes affecting longevity and the production of some antimicrobial peptides. However, varroa parasitism caused the development of viral populations and a decrease in metabolism, specifically by inhibiting protein metabolism essential to bee health. This harmful effect was not reversed by pollen intake. The DGE-tag profiling methods used in this study proved to be a powerful means for analyzing transcriptome variation related to nutrient intake in honey bees. Ultimately, with such an approach, applying genomics tools to nutrition research, nutrigenomics promises to offer a better understanding of how nutrition influences body homeostasis and may help reduce the susceptibility of bees to (less virulent) pathogens.},

abstract = {In principle, the spatial extent of fishery stock assessment should reflect the biological population, and major fishing patterns or population heterogeneity within the area should be represented. However, these theoretical requirements are commonly dismissed in practice, often when there is compelling evidence that spatial scope and structure is mis-specified and without testing if the mis-specified model performs well for informing fishery management. Population dynamics theory, case studies in fishery management as well as simulation tests demonstrate that accurately accounting for spatial structure in stock assessments can improve model performance, and ignoring spatial structure can lead to misperceptions of stock status and failures in fisheries management. Therefore, the development of stock assessment applications should include an evaluation of the most appropriate spatial scope and structure. Some common challenges in defining and modeling spatial structure can be addressed by adopting general best practices, but each species and its fisheries are unique. Accordingly, determining the most appropriate spatial structure involves 1) an interdisciplinary synthesis of all available information to determine the most plausible paradigms of population structure and fishing patterns, 2) the development of spatial operating models that are conditioned on these paradigms, and 3) testing the performance of estimation models and management strategies that are based on the current spatial management unit as well as alternative spatial scopes and structures that reflect population structure and fishing patterns.},

We use state space models and simulation-estimation cycles to evaluate the performance of catch-age analysis. In particular, we design a simulation model with realistic measurement and process error. We then examine how effectively unknown parameters and population sizes can be obtained from an estimation model simplified to conform with common assumptions. We describe circumstances in which, simultaneously with all other parameters, M is estimable from traditional catch-age data. Increased fishing contrast improves estimates of some model parameters, but not M. The variance ratio p relating process error in recruitments with measurement error in the abundance index must be specified in the estimation. We consider both true and ad hoc choices for p. In general, estimation models perform better when the true p is specified and measurement error is low, so that recruitment error is the dominant source of model variability. Thus, well- designed data collection programs are critical to the correct interpretation of actual fishery data.},

abstract = {Serial exploitation comprises a pattern of the human exploitation of wild harvest fisheries, where previously untapped species or locations come under exploitation over both space and time. Unless managed sustainably, serial exploitation can lead to serial depletion of local fisheries, thereby adversely affecting local ecosystems, economies, and communities. Serial depletion is an archetypal problem of the Anthropocene, as its occurrence depends on trade linkages between consumers in one location and suppliers from sometimes geographically very distant fisheries. Invertebrates, especially echinoderms such as sea cucumbers, are subject to serial exploitation that is occurring now on a global scale. We found that the serial depletion of sea cucumbers was consistent with variability in the global mean price for sea cucumbers. When local fisheries are depleted, price tends to rise; a rising price signals previously unexploited fisheries to begin supplying the market. This cycle repeats itself, spreading from the regional to the global scale. Improved understanding of what drives serial exploitation may allow for more successful management of sea cucumber fisheries in the future.},

Production by individual mussels at Bellevue exceeds that in most populations for which appropriate data are available. Detailed comparison with a population in the Lynher estuary, southwest England, confirms previous conclusions, based on physiological measurements, that Lynher mussels experience greater stress than Bellevue mussels, despite the considerable temperature advantage enjoyed by the former.

abstract = {Despite being one of the most common pieces of information used in assessing the status of fish stocks, relative abundance indices based on catch per unit effort (cpue) data are notoriously problematic. Raw cpue is seldom proportional to abundance over a whole exploitation history and an entire geographic range, because numerous factors affect catch rates. One of the most commonly applied fisheries analyses is standardization of cpue data to remove the effect of factors that bias cpue as an index of abundance. Even if cpue is standardized appropriately, the resulting index of relative abundance, in isolation, provides limited information for management advice or about the effect of fishing. In addition, cpue data generally cannot provide information needed to assess and manage communities or ecosystems. We discuss some of the problems associated with the use of cpue data and some methods to assess and provide management advice about fish populations that can help overcome these problems, including integrated stock assessment models, management strategy evaluation, and adaptive management. We also discuss the inappropriateness of using cpue data to evaluate the status of communities. We use tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean as examples. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

However, the situation is confused because perceptions of target and non-target catch vary widely, impeding efforts to estimate bycatch globally. To remedy this, the term needs to be redefined as a consistent definition that establishes what should be considered bycatch. A new definition is put forward as: 'bycatch is catch that is either unused or unmanaged'. Applying this definition to global marine fisheries data conservatively indicates that bycatch represents 40.4 percent of global marine catches, exposing systemic gaps in fisheries policy and management. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Estimating trends in abundance from fishery catch rates is one of the oldest endeavors in fisheries science. However, many jurisdictions do not analyze fishery catch rates due to concerns that these data confound changes in fishing behavior (adjustments in fishing location or gear operation) with trends in abundance. In response, we developed a spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA) model that decomposes covariation in multispecies catch rates into components representing spatial variation and fishing behavior. SDFA estimates spatiotemporal variation in fish density for multiple species and accounts for fisher behavior at large spatial scales (i.e., choice of fishing location) while controlling for fisher behavior at fine spatial scales (e.g., daily timing of fishing activity). We first use a multispecies simulation experiment to show that SDFA decreases bias in abundance indices relative to ignoring spatial adjustments and fishing tactics.Wethen present results for a case study involving petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) in the California Current, for which SDFA estimates initially stable and then increasing abundance for the period 1986–2003, in accordance with fishery-independent survey and stock assessment estimates.},

abstract = {Time/area closures have been widely used in fisheries management to prevent overfishing and the destruction of marine biodiversity. To a lesser degree, such spatio-temporal management measures have been used to reduce by-catch of finfish or protected species. However, as ecosystem-based management approaches are employed and more fisheries are managed through multispecies, multiobjective models, the management of by-catch will likely become increasingly important. The elimination of by-catch has become a primary goal of the fishing policies of many countries. It is particularly relevant in the United States, as the deadline for setting annual catch limits (ACLs) in all fisheries passes in 2011. This will result in a dramatic expansion of the number of catch and by-catch quotas. Such catch measures may result in the early closure of otherwise sustainable fisheries when by-catch quotas are exceeded. To prevent such closures and the consequent economic hardship to fishers and the economy, it is imperative that managers be given the tools necessary to reduce by-catch and improve fishing selectivity. Targeted spatio-temporal fishery closures are one solution open to managers. Here, we examine how the spatio-temporal and oceanographic characteristics of by-catch may be used by managers to design fishery closures, and place these methods within a decision tree to assist managers to identify appropriate management measures. We argue that the current movement towards marine spatial planning (MSP) presents an important impetus to examine how we manage fisheries spatially, and we offer a first step towards the objective participation of fisheries in the MSP process.},

Depth, salinity, temperature, and distance from the Bay mouth were found to be the most important environmental determinants of mature female blue crab distributions. The response curves for these variables displayed patterns that are consistent with laboratory and field studies of blue crab/habitat relationships. The generality of the habitat models was assessed using intra- and inter-annual cross-validation. Although the models generally performed well in cross-validation, some years showed unique habitat relationships that were not well predicted by models from other years. Such variability may be overlooked in habitat suitability models derived from data collected over short time periods. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2005.},

abstract = {State-space models (SSMs) are increasingly used in ecology to model time-series such as animal movement paths and population dynamics. This type of hierarchical model is often structured to account for two levels of variability: biological stochasticity and measurement error. SSMs are flexible. They can model linear and nonlinear processes using a variety of statistical distributions. Recent ecological SSMs are often complex, with a large number of parameters to estimate. Through a simulation study, we show that even simple linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems. We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters. While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and we urge ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately before drawing ecological conclusions from their results.},

Given their unique evolutionary history as opisthokonts, along with metazoans, fungi serve as exceptional models for the evolution of sex and sex-determining regions of the genome (the mating type locus) and for transitions that commonly occur between outcrossing/self-sterile and inbreeding/self-fertile modes of reproduction.

abstract = {In conservation prioritisation, it is often implicit that representation targets for individual habitat types act as surrogates for the species that inhabit them. Yet for many commercially and ecologically important coral reef fish species, connectivity among different habitats in a seascape may be more important than any single habitat alone. Approaches to conservation prioritisation that consider seascape connectivity are thus warranted. I demonstrate an approach that can be implemented within a relatively data-poor context, using widely available conservation planning software. Based on clearly stated assumptions regarding species' habitat usage and movement ability, this approach can be adapted to different focal species and contexts, or refined as further data become available. I first derive a seascape connectivity metric based on area-weighted proximity between juvenile and adult habitat patches, and then apply this during spatial prioritisation using the decision-support software Marxan. Using a case study from Micronesia, I present two applications: first, to inform prioritisation for a network of marine protected areas to achieve regional objectives for habitat representation; and second, to identify nursery habitat patches that are most likely to supply juveniles to adult populations on reefs within existing protected areas. Incorporating seascape connectivity in conservation prioritisation highlights areas where small marine protected areas placed on coral reefs might benefit from proximity to other habitats in the seascape, and thus be more effective. Within the context of community tenure over resources, identification of critical nursery habitats to improve the effectiveness of existing marine protected areas indicates where collaboration across community boundaries might be required. Outputs from these analyses are likely to be most useful in regions where management is highly decentralised, imposing spatial constraints on the size of individual protected areas.},

One class of these methods requires only catch time series and, in some cases, information about life history or fishery characteristics, to estimate stock status. These catch-only methods (COMs) range from statistical models trained on data-rich stocks to mechanistic population models that make assumptions about changes in fishing effort. We review 11 COMs, comparing performance through application to data-rich stocks and simulated fisheries. The catch-only methods evaluated here produce imprecise and biased estimates of B/BMSY, especially for stocks that are lightly exploited. They were also generally poor classifiers of stock status. While no method performed best across all stocks, ensembles of multiple COMs generally performed better than individual COMs. We advocate for testing new COMs using this common platform. We also caution that performance in estimating stock status is not sufficient for gauging the usefulness of COMs in managing fisheries. Greater use of management strategy evaluation is needed before COMs can be considered a reliable tool for management.},

abstract = {In Mediterranean European countries, 85{\%} of the assessed stocks are currently overfished compared to a maximum sustainable yield reference value (MSY) while populations of many commercial species are characterized by truncated size- and age-structures. Rebuilding the size- and age-structure of exploited populations is a management objective that combines single species targets such as MSY with specific goals of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAF), preserving community size-structure and the ecological role of different species. Here, we show that under the current fishing regime, stock productivity and fleet profitability are generally impaired by a combination of high fishing mortality and inadequate selectivity patterns. For most of the stocks analysed, a simple reduction in the current fishing mortality (Fcur) towards an MSY reference value (FMSY), without any change in the fishing selectivity, will allow neither stock biomass nor fisheries yield and revenue to be maximized. On the contrary, management targets can be achieved only through a radical change in fisheries selectivity. Shifting the size of first capture towards the size at which fish cohorts achieve their maximum biomass, the so-called optimal length, would produce on average between two and three times higher economic yields and much higher biomass at sea for the exploited stocks. Moreover, it would contribute to restore marine ecosystem structure and resilience to enhance ecosystem services such as reservoirs of biodiversity and functioning food webs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite slow nutrient supply to the subtropical surface ocean, the rates of annual inorganic carbon uptake and net oxygen production are similar to those of nutrient-rich high-latitude waters. This surprisingly high subtropical carbon uptake cannot be fully accounted for by sediment trap-collected sinking particles and the downward mixing of suspended and dissolved organic carbon. We propose an explanation for these paradoxical observations: gel-like organic matter rich in carbon but poor in nutrients, akin to transparent exopolymer particles, is produced by phytoplankton under nutrient limitation, and a portion sinks into the shallow subsurface, where it is respired by heterotrophic bacteria. This organic matter would evade detection by sediment traps, effectively representing an additional (sinking-driven) source of dissolved organic carbon to the subsurface. Building on existing evidence for the production of such nutrient-poor organic matter in surface waters, we describe evidence for its decomposition in the shallow subsurface of the Sargasso Sea. First, oxygen at these depths is consumed over the summer without comparable production of nitrate. Second, a seasonal change in the},

abstract = {In order to evaluate the impact of heavy exploitation on settlement and recruitment rates of coral reef fishes, the abundances of pre-settlement and pre-recruitment fishes were monitored at Discovery Bay, Jamaica, where fish stocks are heavily exploited and at several sites around the British Virgin Islands (BVI) where exploitation is moderate. Light traps set concurrently at Discovery Bay and at three fringing reefs in BVI caught many species of pre-settlement reef fishes, except grunts and parrotfish, and one BVI site (Hans Creek) may be an area of particularly high settlement. In contrast, heavily exploited fish stocks at Discovery Bay had greatly reduced settlement rates compared with all three sites in BVI. Settlement rates of unexploited species were more similar in Discovery Bay and BVI. Abundances of juvenile fish caught in wire-mesh traps were monitored over several years in Discovery Bay and at three sites in BVI. Consistently low numbers of exploited species were taken at Discovery Bay compared to the BVI sites, indicating that settlement and recruitment rates have been low in recent years. Exploited fish populations in the small marine protected area (MPA) at Discovery Bay are expected to increase very slowly as a result of settlement and recruitment limitation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The levels of the experimental factors-salinity (0-35 parts per thousand) and temperature (10-30 degrees C)-spanned the range occurring in the natal estuary. Survival of eggs to 1 d posthatch (dph) was highest, more than 60{\%}, between 2 parts per thousand and 20 parts per thousand salinity and was reduced significantly (to {\textless}50{\%}) only in salinities of 30 parts per thousand or greater. Similarly, survival of prefeeding larvae was reduced only at salinities above 30 parts per thousand, suggesting that their salinity tolerance is higher than that of U.S. populations. Moreover, 1-7-dph larvae were tolerant to temperature decreases that are lethal to other populations, with around 40{\%} surviving between 10 degrees C and 14 degrees C at intermediate salinities. Older, 23-dph larvae were less tolerant to cold, with fewer than 20{\%} surviving 7 d at 10 degrees C, but these larvae thrived at high temperature, exhibiting highest survival and growth at 26 degrees C across salinities from 1 parts per thousand to 35 parts per thousand. Growth of early juvenile stages (55-104 dph) was independent of salinity (1-30 parts per thousand) and was highest between 26 degrees C and 30 degrees C, suggesting a temperature optimum similar to that of U.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society.Protected and managed species, including harvested fishes, exhibit spatial and temporal variation in their distribution and productivity. Spatio-temporal variation can arise from differences in habitat quality, human impacts (including harvest), density-dependent changes in per capita productivity, as well as individual movement. Human impacts (e.g. direct harvest) also vary spatially and over time, and monitoring the overlap between impacts and population distribution is necessary to ensure that human impacts are sustainable and to prioritize research and management for populations that are heavily impacted. However, estimating spatio-temporal variation in human impacts and population dynamics while accounting for individual movement has remained computationally challenging for decades. We developed a spatial population growth (also known as 'surplus production') model that is inspired by finite element analysis, which estimates spatio-temporal population dynamics given density-dependent population regulation, individual movement and spatially explicit harvest. We demonstrate the method using data for big skate Raja binoculata in the California Current from 2003 to 2013 and demonstrate that results can be processed to estimate an upper limit on sustainable harvest (an 'overfishing limit'). We also conduct a simulation experiment to explore the small-sample properties of parameter estimates. A simulation experiment confirms that real-world sample sizes are sufficient to estimate the sustainable harvest level within 20{\%} of its actual value. However, sample sizes are likely insufficient to reliably estimate movement rates. The spatial population growth model estimates an overfishing limit of 740-890 metric tonnes for big skate from 2010 to 2013, compared with annual harvest {\textless}100 tonnes. This suggests that recent harvest of big skate is likely sustainable, and sensitivity analysis confirms that this conclusion is robust to different potential rates for individual movement. Synthesis and applications. We recommend that spatio-temporal population models be used across systems and taxa to monitor the spatial overlap between species distribution and human impacts. For big skate, we recommend management rules triggering additional data collection and assessment effort if harvest rates substantially increase. We also recommend future research regarding spatial management regulations for emerging fisheries.},

Monthly patterns of larval supply differed among selected species, but overall trends were similar between the two sites for most species. However, despite the geographical proximity of the two sites, the fished area received a consistently higher abundance and diversity of larvae than the marine reserve throughout the study period. Patterns in larval supply generally were reflected in the settlement patterns of Stegastes partitus.

abstract = {Fish populations vary because of density dependent and independent processes that determine recruitment, growth, and natural mortality, and in response to fishing. Most of the natural (non-fishing) variability is associated with recruitment, presumably the density independent effect of fluctuating environmental factors.Numerous empirical models have been used to explain recruitment variability. While "statistically significant" correlations are plentiful, most empirical studies are flawed because they a) use an inappropriate proxy for recruitment, b) are data exploration exercises that are not based on a plausible a priori hypothesis, c) do not consider, simultaneously, physical variables and spawning biomass, and/or d) fail to test predictions on independent data (i.e., not used to establish correlation). As a result, many empirical models fail to predict post-publication events. Furthermore, fundamentally different empirical models may be indistinguishable because they account for virtually the same proportion of variability in recruitment.Process-oriented studies of recruitment variability have focused on starvation, particularly of first-feeding larvae. Starvation may be related to the amount of suitable food, the contagious nature of its distribution, currents which transport eggs and larvae, the match or mismatch of the annual reproductive cycles with the annual production cycle of prey, and the stability of the environment. Only recently has a new hypothesis emerged, namely, that predation is the major cause of prerecruit mortality. It is supported by a) evidence of prey concentrations which are adequate for a high survival of larvae as indicated by laboratory and modeling studies, b) lack of evidence of starvation for field collected larvae, c) a high survival rate of larvae in large, predation- free, enclosures, d) the high mortality rate of eggs and yolk-sac larvae which are not subject to starvation, and e) the identification of fish and invertebrates as predators of egg, larval , and post-larval stages.At least for some systems, fish consume most of their own production. Two important implictions are that fish populations are probably able to compensate for fishing, and post-larval mortality must be high, thus affecting recruitment. The lack of correlation between larval abundance and recruitment also implies that year-class strength is not established until the post-larval stage{\textregistered} Physical factors are presumed to be responsible for recruitment variability. There are numerous possible mechanisms if recruitment is determined by starvation of larvae. It is less apparent how physical factors are related to variability in predation mortality of post-larvae.},

Samples are often analysed using a “delta-model” that combines two separate generalized linear models, GLMs (for encounter probability and positive catch rates), or less often using a compound Poisson-gamma (CPG) distribution that is computationally expensive. I discuss three theoretical problems with the conventional delta-model: difficulty interpreting covariates for encounter probability, the assumed independence of the two GLMs, and the biologically implausible form when eliminating covariates for either GLM. I then derive an alternative “Poisson-link model” that solves these problems. To illustrate, I use biomass samples for 113 fish populations to show that the Poisson-link model improves fit (and decreases residual spatial variation) for {\textgreater}80{\%} of populations relative to the conventional delta-model. A simulation experiment illustrates that CPG and Poisson-link models estimate covariate effects that are similar and biologically interpretable. I therefore recommend the Poisson-link model as a useful alternative to the conventional delta-model with similar properties to the CPG distribution.},

Habcam data for each tow consist of multiple images that give information on within-tow variability of scallop density. The model accounts for these multiple observations as well as the possibility of differences between the true densities in dredge and Habcam pairs due to the pairs not covering exactly the same ground. We fit several models with alternative assumptions to observations on Atlantic sea scallops and compare the relative performance using Akaike's information criterion. The best performing model estimated higher dredge efficiency on fine substrates than on coarse ones (approximately 0.40 and 0.27, respectively). Our results inform the scale of annual abundance estimates from dredge surveys and reduce uncertainty in the sea scallop stock assessments.},

Growth increased with higher temperatures during the fish growing season (December-May) and also increased with higher freshwater flow during the period important for seagrass growth (July- February). We hypothesise that fish are responding to enhanced productivity in the seagrass food web, driven by increased nutrient input from freshwater flows. Fish also appear to be responding to higher temperatures via a direct physiological pathway. We then predicted fish growth under 3 plausible climate change scenarios. Growth is predicted to increase across all our projections, because any predicted decrease in river flow will likely be offset by rapid predicted increases in temperature. Our results highlight the value of understanding the drivers of long-term growth variation in harvested fishes as this allows for the prediction of future productivity under a range of environmental and management scenarios.},

abstract = {Nontarget catch restrictions are becoming common in fisheries management. We test a potential tool for reducing nontargeted catch that combines species' distribution models and ocean forecast models. We evaluated our approach for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), and blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis). Catch of the latter two species is capped in commercial fisheries of the former two species. Ocean forecasts were derived from a data-assimilative ocean forecast model that predicts conditions 0–2 days into the future. Observed oceanographic conditions were derived from CTD casts and observed fish presence–absence was derived from fishery-independent bottom trawl collections. Species distribution models were used to predict presence–absence based on observed and forecasted oceanographic conditions, and predictions for both were very similar. Thus, most of the error in predicted distributions was generated by the species distribution mo...},

abstract = {This paper investigates the biological reference points, such as the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), for the Pella Tomlinson and the Fox surplus production models (SPM) in the presence of a multiplicative environmental noise. These models are used in fisheries stock assessment as a firsthand tool for the elaboration of harvesting strategies. We derive conditions on the environmental noise distribution that insure that the biomass process for an SPM has a stationary distribution, so that extinction is avoided. Explicit results about the stationary behavior of the biomass distribution are provided for a particular specification of the noise. The consideration of random noise in the MSY calculations leads to more conservative harvesting target than deterministic models. The derivations account for a possible noise autocorrelation that represents the occurrence of spells of good and bad years. The impact of the noise is found to be more severe on Pella Tomlinson model for which the asymmetry parameter p is large while it is less important for Fox model. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability. 2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature. 3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change. 4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change},

@article{Goethel2011,
abstract = {Investigations into population structure have been at the forefront of fisheries research for decades, yet it is generally ignored in stock assessment models. As the complex nature of marine population structure has been uncovered, models have attempted to accurately portray it through the development of spatially explicit assessments that allow for movement between sub-populations. Although current tag-integrated movement models are highly complex, many arose from the relatively simple models of Beverton and Holt (1957). This article traces the historical development of these models and compares their features. Originally estimation of movement utilized only tag-recapture models, but now tag-integrated assessment models incorporate several sources of fishery, survey, and tag-recapture information to inform movement estimates. As spatial management measures become more widely used, it is increasingly important that assessment models include the spatial complexities of population structure and patterns of fishery removals, in order for more reliable monitoring of population rebuilding to take place. A generalized metapopulation model is proposed for use in fisheries stock assessment, which allows for adult movement among spatially discrete sub-populations. The input requirements for the model include region-specific catch-at-age, a tag-recapture dataset, and auxiliary information, such as a fishery-independent abundance index.},

abstract = {Current speed often varies with depth, so vertical movements of larvae are expected to have profound effects on dispersal velocity and therefore dispersal potential. Systematic behaviours are expected to have strong effects on dispersal. However, reliable information on the presence of vertical migrations in larvae is scarce, but the few well investigated empirical examples justify a detailed simulation study and an analysis of potential effects. We present a spatially explicit 3D hydrodynamic model that incorporates biological information in the form of active particles advected in a Lagrangian fashion. The set-up is designed to analyze the sensitivity of dispersal distances to variation in vertical behaviour of larvae. We simulated short (4 days) pelagic larval durations (PLDs) to determine whether behaviour might be important over short dispersal periods. We found that sinusoidal behaviours (slow vertical migration) in or out of phase with tides did not significantly change the dispersal patterns compared to those of larvae that remained at the surface. By contrast, a quadratic pattern of behaviour resulting in rapid vertical migration, in or out of phase with tides, had dramatic effects on both distance and direction of dispersal. The resulting dispersal kernels were found to be multimodal due to the interaction between tidal and meteorological components in flow. Incorporating biological information on larval migrations in Lagrangian simulation of dispersal will be important in estimates of connectivity and forecasting marine reserve networks.},

abstract = {Predicting species distribution and habitat suitability (HS) modelling, across broad spatial scales, is now a major challenge in marine ecology. The resulting knowledge is of considerable use in supporting the implementation of environmental legislation, integrated coastal zone management and ecosystem-based fisheries management. This contribution considers the identification of seafloor morphological characteristics, together with wave energy conditions, that determine the presence of European lobster (Homarus gammarus); and it predicts suitable habitats over the Basque continental shelf (Bay of Biscay), in summer. The results obtained, by applying Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA), indicate that lobster habitat differs considerably from the mean environmental condition over the study area; likewise, that it is restrictive in terms of the range of conditions in which they dwell. The best of the environmental predictors found to be: distance to the rock substrate; Benthic Position Index; wave flux over the seafloor; and the underlying bathymetry. A habitat suitability map was produced, with a high model quality (Boyce index: 0.98 ± 0.06). The most suitable habitat for European lobster are locations at the boundary between sedimentary- and rocky-bottoms, coincident with seafloor depressions with a steep slope, with medium to high wave energy conditions, and located within a range of water depths of 35-40 m. This approach demonstrates the applicability of the method in case studies where only presence data are available, together with the inclusion of environmental variables obtained from different sources. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This narrow view of evolution has become untenable in light of recent observations from genomic sequencing and population-genetic theory. Numerous aspects of genomic architecture, gene structure, and developmental pathways are difficult to explain without invoking the nonadaptive forces of genetic drift and mutation. In addition, emergent biological features such as complexity, modularity, and evolvability, all of which are current targets of considerable speculation, may be nothing more than indirect by-products of processes operating at lower levels of organization. These issues are examined in the context of the view that the origins of many aspects of biological diversity, from gene-structural embellishments to novelties at the phenotypic level, have roots in nonadaptive processes, with the population-genetic environment imposing strong directionality on the paths that are open to evolutionary exploitation.},

Recent studies show that the approach may precisely identify spatial hotspots in species distribution, but have not addressed whether seasonal hotspots are identifiable using commonly available fishery data. In this study, we analyzed the seasonal spatio-temporal distribution of pelagic sharks in the western and central North Pacific using fishery catch rates and a generalized linear mixed model with spatio-temporal effects. Different spatial distribution patterns were observed between two shark species. The hotspots of shortfin mako (SFM) appeared in the vicinity of the coastal and offshore waters of Japan and the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone (TZ), whereas the hotspots of blue shark (BSH) were widely distributed in the areas from the TZ to the waters of the Emperor Seamount Chain. Shortfin mako distribution changes seasonally with clear north-south movement, which follows higher sea surface temperatures (SST). However, preferred spring and summer water temperature was still colder than those in fall and winter, but not as cold as for BSH, which did not show seasonal north-south movement. BSH exhibits seasonal east-west movement apparently unrelated to temperature. The spatial fishing effort by season generally follows the seasonal movement of temperature possibly making SFM more vulnerable to the fishery than BSH. These findings could be used to reduce the capture risk of bycatch sharks and to better manage the spatial distribution of fishing for targeted sharks.},

We describe this trough in the context of a larger system that comprises a range of elements, viz: 1) Scour troughs extending 170m below mean sea level are incised into thick glaciomarine sediments and have exhumed bedrock over wide areas. The flanking uneroded terrain has low relief and a winnowed surface. 2) Sets of sand banner banks off Cape D'Or and Cape Chignecto. 3) The atypical set of banner banks at Cape Split, consisting of the Scots Bay dune field and its counterpart, a large gravel bank trapped in the Minas Passage scour trough. 4) Low-relief banks with sand ribbons and barchan dunes alongside some banner banks, and termed 'shadow banks'. 5) A large (0.8km 3) sediment drift at the entrance to Minas Channel (without large bedforms). The location of troughs and banks can be correlated with tidal-current patterns: trenches are located in regions of very strong bi-directional currents; banner banks near headland-sited tidal gyres; shadow banks in areas of maximum mean bottom stress asymmetry; and the sediment drift at the entrance to Minas Channel in an area of weak bottom stress at all stages of the tides. Previous work has argued that the scour system formed after 3400 14Cyrs BP (radiocarbon years before present) following collapse of a barrier system across Minas Passage. We speculate that formation of the scour trough system may have released vast quantities of sediment that have not been accounted for in previous sediment budgets, and that much of this released sediment has been sequestered in the late-Holocene salt marshes at the head of the Bay of Fundy. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {The translation of survey data into estimates of absolute abundance hinges on the availability of an accurate estimate of gear efficiency. In many fisheries, however, a wide range of estimates exists and research directed at quantifying this critical parameter has focused on relatively small, fishery-independent data sets. In the present study, a technique was developed to utilize the copious amounts of data available from an open-ocean fishery for sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus in a spatially explicit depletion model. In June 1999, Georges Bank Closed Area II was opened to the commercial scallop fleet after a 5-year multispecies fishing ban. During the 5-month opening, the spatial distribution and magnitude of fishing effort was tracked through vessel monitoring systems, and a relatively small but still substantial number of catch observations were made aboard vessels from the commercial fleet. A spatial analysis of both catch and effort data was utilized to select areas consistent with the assumptions of a DeLury analysis. Maximum likelihood estimation was then used to generate a single estimate of the catchability coefficient (and thus efficiency), while simultaneously estimating the initial abundance in each area. The gear efficiency of the New England-style scallop dredge used during the fishing season was estimated to be 42.7{\%}. A sensitivity analysis of model results shows a potential range of 35.5-52.5{\%}, depending on model assumptions.},

abstract = {Catches and biomass in the Maine lobster fishery have been at record levels in recent years despite sustained high exploitation rates. The fishery is almost completely based on lobsters just molting to legal size each year and thus is vulnerable to changes in environmental or ecological conditions that reduce recruitment. I use a bioeconomic model of the fishery that incorporates an empirically estimated vessel-level production function to evaluate how a reduction in recruitment might affect profitability and optimal effort levels relative to recent years. While large reductions in effort would almost certainly be required to maintain fishery profitability, the degree of effort reduction and the optimal seasonal distribution of effort and catch are sensitive to the time series of data used to estimate the production function. Because of the unidirectional upward trend in recruitment and catches, it is unclear whether changes in the production function are due to technological innovation or ecological change. However, the answer has important implications for the level of effort the fishery may be able to profitably support in the future. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Stock assessment models are fitted to abundance-index, fishery catch, and age–length–sex composition data that are estimated from survey and fishery records. Research has developed spatiotemporal methods to estimate abundance indices, but there is little research regarding model-based methods to generate age–length–sex composition data. We demonstrate a spatiotemporal approach to generate composition data and a multinomial sample size that approximates the estimated imprecision. A simulation experiment comparing spatiotemporal and design-based methods demonstrates a 32{\%} increase in input sample size for the spatiotemporal estimator. A Stock Synthesis assessment used to manage lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) in the California Current also shows a 17{\%} increase in sample size and better model fit using the spatiotemporal estimator, resulting in smaller standard errors when estimating spawning biomass. We conclude that spatiotemporal approaches are feasible for estimating both abundance-index and compositional data, thereby providing a unified approach for generating inputs for stock assessments. We hypothesize that spatiotemporal methods will improve statistical efficiency for composition data in many stock assessments and recommend that future research explore the impact of including additional habitat or sampling covariates.},

abstract = {The frequently observed positive relationship between fish population abundance and spatial distribution suggests that changes in distribution can be indicative of trends in abundance. If contractions in spatial distribution precede declines in spawning stock biomass (SSB), spatial distribution reference points could complement the SSB reference points that are commonly used in marine conservation biology and fisheries management. When relevant spatial distribution information is integrated into fisheries management and recovery plans, risks and uncertainties associated with a plan based solely on the SSB criterion would be reduced. To assess the added value of spatial distribution data, we examine the relationship between SSB and four metrics of spatial distribution intended to reflect changes in population range, concentration, and density for 10 demersal populations (9 species) inhabiting the Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic. Our primary purpose is to assess their potential to serve as indices of SSB, using fisheries independent survey data. We find that metrics of density offer the best correlate of spawner biomass. A decline in the frequency of encountering high density areas is associated with, and in a few cases preceded by, rapid declines in SSB in 6 of 10 populations. Density-based indices have considerable potential to serve both as an indicator of SSB and as spatially based reference points in fisheries management.},

To reduce the evaluation time of prospective candidates, reliable accelerated decay methodologies are necessary for laboratory screening of potential preservatives. Ongoing research at Mississippi State University has focused upon utilizing custom built equipment to measure stiffness losses in wood wafers after 4 weeks of fungal exposure as opposed to mass losses in blocks after 12 weeks. Stiffness loss as a measure to quantify the extent of biodeterioration may allow detection of incipient decay. The resistance of untreated and treated southern yellow pine and radiata pine (Pinus radiata) sapwood wafers to biodeterioration by brown rot (Neolentinus lepideus, Gloeophyllum trabeum and Postia placenta) and white rot (Trametes versicolor and Irpex lacteus) fungi was investigated by measuring stiffness. From the data collected percentage stiffness losses were calculated based upon modulus of elasticity. It is a potentially accurate alternative to the "secant modulus" at a deformation equal to 5{\%} of the specimen height calculation generally performed. {\textcopyright} 2008 by Walter de Gruyter.},

abstract = {Abstract: The American lobster Homarus americanus supports one of the most valuable fisheries in the USA. One of the important monitoring programs is for benthically settled lobsters, which closely relates to recruitment. The lobster settlement sampling program follows a fixed-station design. However, the performance of this design has not been evaluated, and we are unclear if the design can capture the temporal dynamics of settlers, in particular in response to changes in spatial distribution of lobster in the last 2 decades. In this study, we compared the fixed-station design with a random sampling design for the mid-coast region of the Gulf of Maine. We developed a generalized additive model (GAM) to quantify the relationship between habitat variables and density of early benthic phase and older juvenile lobsters by using the data from inshore trawl surveys from 1989 to 2012. The GAM model was then used to simulate putative true populations using the habitat variables. The two different sampling designs were applied to sample the simulated true populations. The fixed-station sampling design tended to underestimate the true density but could capture the temporal trends in settler density. A persistence index analysis suggests that the fixed-station design could identify interannual change of the lobster settler density. This study suggests that fixed-station sampling design is effective in monitoring temporal changes in settler density but could not be used for the estimation of absolute density of settlers.

abstract = {This paper reviews and ranks major proposed energy-related solutions to global warming, air pollution mortality, and energy security while considering other impacts of the proposed solutions, such as on water supply, land use, wildlife, resource availability, thermal pollution, water chemical pollution, nuclear proliferation, and undernutrition. Nine electric power sources and two liquid fuel options are considered. The electricity sources include solar-photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, tidal, nuclear, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The liquid fuel options include corn-ethanol (E85) and cellulosic-E85. To place the electric and liquid fuel sources on an equal footing, we examine their comparative abilities to address the problems mentioned by powering new-technology vehicles, including battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), and flex-fuel vehicles run on E85. Twelve combinations of energy source-vehicle type are considered. Upon ranking and weighting each combination with respect to each of 11 impact categories, four clear divisions of ranking, or tiers, emerge. Tier 1 (highest-ranked) includes wind-BEVs and wind-HFCVs. Tier 2 includes CSP-BEVs, geothermal-BEVs, PV-BEVs, tidal-BEVs, and wave-BEVs. Tier 3 includes hydro-BEVs, nuclear-BEVs, and CCS-BEVs. Tier 4 includes corn- and cellulosic-E85. Wind-BEVs ranked first in seven out of 11 categories, including the two most important, mortality and climate damage reduction. Although HFCVs are much less efficient than BEVs, wind-HFCVs are still very clean and were ranked second among all combinations. Tier 2 options provide significant benefits and are recommended. Tier 3 options are less desirable. However, hydroelectricity, which was ranked ahead of coal-CCS and nuclear with respect to climate and health, is an excellent load balancer, thus recommended. The Tier 4 combinations (cellulosic- and corn-E85) were ranked lowest overall and with respect to climate, air pollution, land use, wildlife damage, and chemical waste. Cellulosic-E85 ranked lower than corn-E85 overall, primarily due to its potentially larger land footprint based on new data and its higher upstream air pollution emissions than corn-E85. Whereas cellulosic-E85 may cause the greatest average human mortality, nuclear-BEVs cause the greatest upper-limit mortality risk due to the expansion of plutonium separation and uranium enrichment in nuclear energy facilities worldwide. Wind-BEVs and CSP-BEVs cause the least mortality. The footprint area of wind-BEVs is 2–6 orders of magnitude less than that of any other option. Because of their low footprint and pollution, wind-BEVs cause the least wildlife loss. The largest consumer of water is corn-E85. The smallest are wind-, tidal-, and wave-BEVs. The US could theoretically replace all 2007 onroad vehicles with BEVs powered by 73000–144000 5 MW wind turbines, less than the 300000 airplanes the US produced during World War II, reducing US CO2 by 32.5–32.7{\%} and nearly eliminating 15000/yr vehicle-related air pollution deaths in 2020. In sum, use of wind, CSP, geothermal, tidal, PV, wave, and hydro to provide electricity for BEVs and HFCVs and, by extension, electricity for the residential, industrial, and commercial sectors, will result in the most benefit among the options considered. The combination of these technologies should be advanced as a solution to global warming, air pollution, and energy security. Coal-CCS and nuclear offer less benefit thus represent an opportunity cost loss, and the biofuel options provide no certain benefit and the greatest negative impacts.},

abstract = {THE structure of natural populations of animals and plants and of variation both within and between colonies needs more study as Diver (1940) has pointed out. Research along these lines is of particular importance because of the evidence he has obtained that many, apparently continuous, natural populations are broken up into small breeding-communities, giving the conditions in which genetic drift, as suggested by Sewall Wright (e.g. 1940), might be expected to occur if it were operative. Diver has stated that from his observations on populations of Cepeea nemoralis (L.) and C. hortensis (MUll.) he obtained no indications that the variations in shell colour and banding have any selective value. He considers that these small breeding-communities show definite divergences from each other because of non-random mating, but expresses surprise (1940, p. 312) that such divergences have not proceeded further by means of genetical drift. The purpose of this paper is to describe an investigation into this problem of the relative importance of selection and drift in deter- mining the distribution of different colour and banding patterns in C. nemoralis. We find, on the contrary, that they have definite selective values, related to the environment, determining the general aspect of different populations and therefore of their gene ratios. Although small inbreeding communities within each population may diverge from one another in colour and banding patterns, this random divergence cannot proceed far, because of the effects of natural selection.},

Ignoring trends in productivity led to overestimates of productivity and underestimates of capacity when both exploitation rates and productivity declined over time, resulting in an underestimation on average of benchmarks of biological status. Despite being less biased, time-varying models had relatively poor fit based on AICc and BIC model selection criteria. Our simulation results were compared with empirical analyses of 12 Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks in British Columbia, Canada. Although benchmarks were less biased when based on time-varying models, underlying true benchmarks based on spawner abundances at maximum sustainable yield, SMSY, trend downwards when productivity declines, which may not be aligned with conservation objectives. We conclude with best practices when adapting biological benchmarks to time-varying productivity.},

However, scallop fishing vessels concentrate fishing in areas that consistently exhibit high densities resulting in a nonuniform spatial distribution of fishing effort. This study applies a spatial model for fishing effort derived from satellite vessel monitoring system data, scallop habitat suitability maps, and relative scallop density from a spatial stock assessment model to evaluate precautionary approach reference points in support of sustainable management. Target harvest rates were evaluated in terms of MSY for the higher habitat suitability areas. The results indicated that although MSY for the spatial model were similar to those when assuming a uniform distribution of effort, the biomass and catch rates over all areas were higher. The spatial model predicted that the MSY would be taken with less fishing effort, potentially lessening the benthic impacts from the scallop fishery.},

Scientific understanding of low-frequency climate–ocean variability, which is manifested as ecosystem regime shifts and states, has led to attempts to incorporate these shifts and states into fisheries assessment and management. To date, operationalizing these attempts to provide tactical advice has met with limited success.

abstract = {The choice of the sampling locations in a spatial network is often guided by practical demands. In particular, many locations are preferentially chosen to capture high values of a response, for example, air pollution levels in environmental monitoring. Then, model estimation and prediction of the exposure surface become biased because of the selective sampling. As prediction is often the main utility of the modeling, we suggest that the effect of preferential sampling lies more importantly in the resulting predictive surface than in parameter estimation. We take demonstration of this effect as ourfocus. In particular, our contribution is to offer a direct simulation-based approach to assessing the effects of preferential sampling. We compare two predictive surfaces over the study region, one originating from the notion of an "operating" intensity, driving the selection of monitoring sites, the other under complete spatial randomness. We can consider a range of response models. They may reflect the operating intensity, introduce alternative informative covariates, or just propose a flexible spatial model. Then, we can generate data under the given model. Upon fitting the model and interpolating (kriging), we will obtain two predictive surfaces to compare with the known truth. It is important to note that we need suitable metrics to compare the surfaces and that the predictive surfaces are random, so we need to make expected comparisons. We also present an examination of real data using ozone exposures. Here, what we can show is that, within a given network, there can be substantial differences in the spatial prediction using preferentially chosen locations versus roughly randomly selected locations and that the latter provide much improved predictive validation. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Charles Darwin introduced a novel idea into the concept of species, namely that species are branches in the lines of descent (segments of population lineages). In addition to this novel evolutionary component, Darwin's species concept also retained an older taxonomic component, namely the view that the species category is a taxonomic rank; moreover, he adopted amount of difference as a criterion for ranking lineages as species. Subsequent biologists retained both components of Darwin's species concept, although they replaced Darwin's ranking criterion with ranking criteria that either are more objectively defined or relate more directly to the biological bases of lineage separation and divergence. Numerous alternative ranking criteria were proposed, resulting in a prolifera- tion of species definitions and a controversy concerning the concept of species. That controversy can be resolved by distinguishing more explicitly between the theoretical concept of species and the operational criteria that are used to apply the concept in practice. By viewing the various alternative ranking criteria as operational indicators of lineage separation rather than necessary properties of species, the conflicts among competing species concepts are eliminated, resulting in a unified concept of species. A brief examination of the history of biology reveals that an important shift related to the unified species concept has been emerging ever since Darwin reformulated the concept of species with an evolutionary basis. The species category is effectively being decoupled from the hierarchy of taxonomic ranks and transferred to the hierarchy of biological organization. Published 2011.

The model seeks the most likely time series of abundance and mortality, and distributes the residual error among all types of data according to each type´s consistency with the synthetic estimates. the data base for nothern anchovy Engraulis mordax includes two independent fisheries, and auxiliary source of age-composition data, a 6-year time series of accurate spawning biomass measurements by the egg-production method (EPM), and two longer time series of biomass indices. Specific biological relationships in the northern anchovy model are an influence of chub mackerel Scomber japonicus on natural mortality, and an influence of ocean temperature on patterns in age-specific availability and the fraction of 1-year-old fish that are mature. The synthetic estimates of spawning biomass since 1980 typically are within 15{\%} of the measurements made by the EPM. This high precision demosntrates the consistency between changes in biomass measured by the EPM and changes expected from recruitment information in the age-composition data. Consistency between the other biomass indexes and age-composition data were lower. Nevertheless, the other biomass indexes are valuable for defining trends in the estimates 33-year time series.},

@article{McGarvey2017,
abstract = {The Northern Zone rock lobster fishery in South Australia is extensive, covering ca. 207 000 km2. Managed under transferable quotas, the majority of the annual total allowable commercial catch (TACC) is taken on eastern inshore grounds, targeting the smaller redder lobsters favoured by Chinese buyers. The confined nature of fishing under the TACC system has led to concerns of localized spatial depletion and suggested a need for spatial management. A regional partition of the TACC was proposed. Formal prescriptive decision-rule tables for setting regional TACCs annually were constructed based on target exploitation rates. A target exploitation rate of 20{\%} historically produced zero average yearly change in biomass and, in previous bioeconomic projection modelling, achieved near-optimal net economic return. Using an agebased fishery assessment model that fits to catch totals by both weight and number landed, conditioning on fishing effort and mean weightsat- age, we estimated harvestable biomass for three regions. The management response was to establish inner and outer subzones where separate TACC decision rules are now adopted. Basing the harvest strategy on a target exploitation rate underlies a simple direct method for constructing decision-rule tables for setting TACC using the indicator of previous year's catch per unit effort (cpue). In the normal cpue range, a constant target exploitation rate is applied. At lower levels of stock abundance, below a designated upper limit reference point of cpue, the exploitation rates used to assign TACCs are set to decline linearly from the normal target level, reaching zero at a designated lower-limit reference cpue point below which the fishery is closed. At higher levels of cpue, stakeholders agreed to a TACC cap, under which exploitation rate decreases if biomass rises. This case study applies where formal harvest strategy decision rules for quota-based lobster fisheries are considered at finer spatial scales.},

@article{Cope2009,
abstract = {Current fisheries management policies generally require an assessment of stock status, which is a difficult task when population and fisheries data are limited. Three simple metrics based on catch length compositions (i.e., that reflect exclusive take of mature individuals, P mat ; that consist primarily of fish of optimal size, the size at which the highest yield from a cohort occurs, P opt ; and that demonstrate the conservation of large, mature individuals, P mega ) can be used to monitor population status relative to exploitation. The metrics (collectively referred to as P x ) were intended to avoid growth and recruitment overfishing, but there was no quantitative linkage to stock status and calculation of future sustainable catches. We attempt to make this connection by exploring the relationship of P x measures to fishing mortality and spawning biomass (SB). The relationships are compared specifically to the current target reference point (0.4 times the virgin, or unfished, SB [SB0]) and limit reference point (0.25SB0) used for the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery by using simulations based on a deterministic age-structured population dynamics model. Sensitivity to fishery selectivity, life history traits, and recruitment compensation (steepness) is explored. Each P x measure showed a wide range of possible values depending on fishery selectivity, steepness, and the ratio of the length at maturity (L mat ) to the optimal fishing length (L opt ). Although the values of P x may be compatible with sustainable fishing, these values are not always sufficient to ensure stock protection from overfishing. Moreover, values for P x cannot be interpreted adequately without knowledge of the selectivity pattern. A new measure, P obj (the sum of P mat , P opt , and P mega ), is introduced to distinguish selectivity patterns and construct a decision tree for development of stock status indicators. Heuristic indicator values are presented to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Although several caveats remain, this approach builds on the recommendations of previous literature by giving further guidance related to interpreting catch length composition data under variable fishery conditions without collecting additional information. It also provides a link to developing harvest control rules that inform proactive fisheries management under data-limited conditions. {\textcopyright} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2009.},

abstract = {Disease mapping studies the distribution of relative risks or rates in space and time, and typically relies on generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) including fixed effects and spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal random effects. These GLMMs are typically not identifiable and constraints are required to achieve sensible results. However, automatic specification of constraints can sometimes lead to misleading results. In particular, the penalized quasi-likelihood fitting technique automatically centers the random effects even when this is not necessary. In the Bayesian approach, the recently-introduced integrated nested Laplace approximations computing technique can also produce wrong results if constraints are not well-specified. In this paper the spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction random effects are reparameterized using the spectral decompositions of their precision matrices to establish the appropriate identifiability constraints. Breast cancer mortality data from Spain is used to illustrate the ideas.},

Tests were accomplished by holding 500 striped bass yolk-sac larvae in each of two 75 L chambers at four locations in the river ranging from north of Philadelphia, PA to Salem, NJ and at one location in the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. Survival varied significantly among stations; highest survival was in the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, where it averaged more than 50{\%}. Lowest survival occurred at the station near Salem, NJ, approximately 30 km downriver of the primary spawning grounds, where less than 1{\%} of the larvae survived in any of the tests.

Recent molecular analyses of a handful of genes that are involved in maintaining reproductive isolation between species (speciation genes) have provided some striking insights.

abstract = {In the context of ecosystem-based fisheries management, which should consider changing and uncertain environmental conditions, the development of ecosystem-based biological reference points (EBRPs) to account for important multi-species (MS) interactions, fishery operations, and climate change, is of paramount importance for sustainable fisheries management. However, EBRPs under varying plankton productivity states and fisheries management strategies are seldom developed, and the ecosystem effects of these changes are still largely unknown. In this study, ecosystem-based FMSY (fishing mortality rate at MSY) values were estimated within an end-to-end ecosystem model (OSMOSE) for three focused fish species (Pacific Herring, Clupea pallasii; Pacific Cod, Gadus macrocephalus; Lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus) under three plankton productivity states of differing plankton biomass at high, current, and low levels. In addition, ecosystem effects were compared across different plankton productivity and fisheries management strategies with the latter consisting of two fishery scenarios (i.e. single-species-focused (SS) and MS-focused), various fishing mortality rates, and two harvest policies (with and without harvest control rules, HCRs). Main findings of this study include: (i) plankton productivity change affected the values of ecosystem-based FMSY, which increased as plankton productivity states changed from low to high plankton biomass; (ii) ecosystem-based FMSY for Pacific Herring and Pacific Cod stocks increased when fishery scenarios shifted from SS-focused to MS-focused; (iii) fisheries management incorporating HCR yielded more stable system catch and system biomass; and (iv) high plankton biomass combined with fisheries management using HCR could maintain stable ecosystem production and sustainable fisheries. Based on our findings, we highlight possible adaptive fisheries management strategies in the face of future climate and ocean changes. Overall, EBRPs complement SS stock assessments by incorporating key ecological processes and ecosystem properties, thus providing supporting evidence for better incorporation of ecosystem considerations into scientific advice for sustainable fisheries management.},

abstract = {Standardization of catch per unit effort is an effective way to not only extract temporal abundance trends but also understand distribution shifts of fish resources. Chub mackerel in the Northwest Pacific has recently been of great concern to fishermen and fisheries managers because the total catch has been increasing, and fishing grounds have expanded from the Japanese exclusive economic zone eastward to high-sea areas. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of chub mackerel is urgently needed for evaluating the current status (i.e., abundance and distribution) and considering future exploitation. Here we constructed two recruitment indices from pelagic trawl survey data of the Pacific chub mackerel. For recruitment indices of age-0 fish, we integrated an algorithm for automatic area stratification into the delta-GLM that combines two separate generalized linear models (for encounter probability and positive catch rates) to simultaneously investigate changes in relative abundance and distribution. Recruitment indices were high in the recent years of 2013, 2016, and 2017, especially at around 160 °E longitude within the high-sea areas, suggesting simultaneous changes in abundance and distribution. Furthermore, we found that our approach had better predictive ability, especially for positive catch rates, than that of a generalized additive model by cross validation, and the obtained standardized indices mitigated potential bias in stock assessment estimates. Our integrated approach will be useful for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of fishes and standardizing abundance indices for stock assessment and management.},

It considers how the catchability of different fish species in two different types of bottom trawls, the IBTS GOV and the 8-m beam trawl, influences the estimates of species diversity. Maps of groundfish species diversity derived from these two survey trawls are compared to determine the extent to which the maps of spatial variation in groundfish species diversity are influenced by gear type. Catchability-at-length coefficients were applied to the IBTS data to raise the observed catches to estimates of “actual” numbers of fish present in the path of the trawl, which are then used to produce maps of “actual” species diversity across the North Sea. Finally, these raised maps of “actual” groundfish species diversity are shown to be more explainable based on physical environmental parameters such as depth. We suggest that species diversity maps that take account of catchability provide more reliable information on which to base management decisions than “gear-biased” views. The implications for management are discussed, with particular emphasis on using closed areas to conserve marine biodiversity.},

In this Review, I discuss experimental designs to detect the contribution of epistasis to quantitative trait phenotypes in model organisms. These studies indicate that epistasis is common, and that additivity can be an emergent property of underlying genetic interaction networks. Epistasis causes hidden quantitative genetic variation in natural populations and could be responsible for the small additive effects, missing heritability and the lack of replication that are typically observed for human complex traits.},

abstract = {The American lobster Homarus americanas shares rocky shore habitats and resources with two common invasive crab species in the northwest Atlantic: the green crab Carcinus maenas and the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus. Juvenile or early benthic phase (EBP) lobsters live under the same boulders as these crabs and are potentially vulnerable to crab predation and competition. Time-lapse photography was used to quantify aggressive interactions between EBP lobsters and invasive crabs in the laboratory. Lobsters behaved far more aggressively toward Asian shore crabs (initiating 11.8 attacks/h) than green crabs (4.9 attacks/h). Crab behavior varied widely as well, as green crabs were five times more likely to attack EBP lobsters than were Asian shore crabs. Thus, lobsters initiated 75.5{\%} of aggressive interactions with Asian shore crabs, compared with only 22.3{\%} with green crabs. Invasion history was a possible reason for this disparity, as green crabs have shared geographic range with American lobsters for more than 100 y. compared with only more than 10 y for Asian shore crabs. Differences in lobster responses to the two crab species suggest that aggressive behavior is the default for EBP lobsters and that they attacked the novel species (H. sanguineus) because they had not developed avoidance behavior to the potential crab threat. Green crabs posed more of a predation threat than Asian shore crabs, consuming over 80{\%} of lobsters in 24-h trials. These results suggest that invasion history and predator-prey adaptation may shape the behavior and ecological interactions of native and invasive species.},

Recent studies suggest that these aspects of the economically and ecologically important deepwater hake Merluccius paradoxus are not reflected in the current assessment and management practices for the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem. In this study, we compiled data from multiple demersal trawl surveys from the entire distribution area and applied state-of-the-art geostatistical population modelling (GeoPop) to estimate growth rate, mortality, and spatial and temporal distribution patterns of M. paradoxus. The data and the model enabled us to follow temporal and spatial changes in the distribution and infer movements from the recruitment/nursery areas, through the juvenile phase and the adults' migration to the spawning areas outside/upstream of the nursery areas. The results indicated one primary recruitment/nursery area on the west coast of South Africa and a secondary less-productive recruitment/nursery area on the south coast near Port Elizabeth. Juveniles initially migrated away from the main recruitment area, followed by natal homing by larger individuals. This pattern was highly consistent through the time-series of the study. This perception of a, primarily, panmictic population that performs transboundary migrations between Namibia and South Africa corresponds largely to the hypothesis and data plots given in recent studies. We recommend that fisheries assessment, advice and management take into consideration these aspects of the distribution and population (stock) structure of M. paradoxus.},

Model-based abundance indices were developed using a delta generalized linear mixed model that incorporates environmental variability for use in stock assessment to understand how the incorporation of environmental variability impacts our understanding of population dynamics. For this study, multiple model-based abundance indices were developed to test the incorporation of environmental covariates in a length-structured assessment of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) stock in the Gulf of Maine – Georges Bank on the possible improvement of stock assessment quality. Comparisons reveal that modelled indices with environmental covariates appear to be more precise than traditional indices, but model performance metrics and hindcasted fishery statuses revealed that these improvements to indices may not necessarily mean an improved assessment. Model-based abundance indices are not intrinsically better than design-based indices and should be tested for each species individually.},

abstract = {The dispersal and transport of larval New Zealand abalone Haliotis iris was simulated using coupled two-dimensional hydrodynamic and Lagrangian particle-trajectory models. The aim was to estimate pelagic larval dispersal potential along the open coast, as a starting point from which basic management questions can be made for this recreationally and commercially important species. Larval dispersal was simulated from representative spawning sites under a range of representative hydrodynamic conditions, including wave-induced circulation cells. Larval presence over near-shore reef habitat declined as the energy of the flow field and corresponding larval dispersal and transport increased. Thus, spawning during high-energy conditions will promote dispersal and transport but reduce successful recruitment on near-shore reefs. This indicates that seeding of the adjacent coast is likely to be sporadic, with existing populations necessarily being somewhat self-recruiting. Results suggest that an ideal management system would ensure that adult populations were maintained at intervals of 10–30 km along the coast to maintain larval supply to areas in between. Dispersal characteristics were specific to the release site, and the simulations suggest that marine reserves can be positioned to accordingly achieve desired functions: for example, optimal choices can be made for seeding areas, recruitment or self-maintaining areas.},

abstract = {Large marine protected areas (MPAs) have recently been established throughout the world at an unprecedented pace, yet the value of these reserves for mobile species conservation remains unclear. Reef shark populations continue to decline even within some of the largest MPAs, fueling unresolved debates over the ability of protected areas to aid mobile species that transit beyond MPA boundaries. We assessed the capacity of a large MPA to conserve grey reef sharks - a Near Threatened species with a widespread distribution and poorly understood offshore movement patterns - using a combination of conventional tags, satellite tags, and an emerging vessel tracking technology. We found that the 54,000 km2U.S. Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the central Pacific Ocean provides substantial protection for grey reef sharks, as two-thirds of satellite-tracked sharks remained within MPA boundaries for the entire study duration. Additionally, our analysis of {\textgreater} 0.5 million satellite detections of commercial fishing vessels identified virtually no fishing effort within the refuge and significant effort beyond the MPA perimeter, suggesting that large MPAs can effectively benefit reef sharks and other mobile species if properly enforced. However, our results also highlight limitations of place-based conservation as some of these reef-associated sharks moved surprising distances into pelagic waters (up to 926 km from Palmyra Atoll, 810 km beyond MPA boundaries). Small-scale fishermen operating beyond MPA boundaries (up to 366 km from Palmyra) captured 2{\%} of sharks that were initially tagged at Palmyra, indicating that large MPAs provide substantial, though incomplete, protection for reef sharks.},

abstract = {Decreasing body size has been proposed as a universal response to increasing temperatures. The physiology behind the response is well established for ectotherms inhabiting aquatic environments: as higher temperatures decrease the aerobic capacity, individuals with smaller body sizes have a reduced risk of oxygen deprivation. However, empirical evidence of this response at the scale of communities and ecosystems is lacking for marine fish species. Here, we show that over a 40-year period six of eight commercial fish species in the North Sea examined underwent concomitant reductions in asymptotic body size with the synchronous component of the total variability coinciding with a 1-2 °C increase in water temperature. Smaller body sizes decreased the yield-per-recruit of these stocks by an average of 23{\%}. Although it is not possible to ascribe these phenotypic changes unequivocally to temperature, four aspects support this interpretation: (i) the synchronous trend was detected across species varying in their life history and life style; (ii) the decrease coincided with the period of increasing temperature; (iii) the direction of the phenotypic change is consistent with physiological knowledge; and (iv) no cross-species synchrony was detected in other species-specific factors potentially impacting growth. Our findings support a recent model-derived prediction that fish size will shrink in response to climate-induced changes in temperature and oxygen. The smaller body sizes being projected for the future are already detectable in the North Sea. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

We apply a recently developed spatiotemporal model that incorporates habitat variables to estimate a model-based abundance index for northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) in the Gulf of Maine. We contrast this spatiotemporal index with a classical design-based index and evaluate the impacts of differences between the two abundance indices on the stock assessment. We show that using the spatiotemporal index in the assessment model greatly alters the estimates of recruitment and spawning stock biomass and the determination of stock status.

abstract = {The advent of an ecosystem-based approach dramatically expanded the scope of fisheries management, creating a critical need for new kinds of data and quantitative approaches that could be integrated into the management system. Ecosystem models are needed to codify the relationships among drivers, pressures and resulting states, and to quantify the trade-offs between conflicting objectives. Incorporating ecosystem considerations requires moving from the single-species models used in stock assessments, to more complex models that include species interactions, environmental drivers and human consequences. With this increasing model complexity, model fit can improve, but parameter uncertainty increases. At intermediate levels of complexity, there is a ‘sweet spot' at which the uncertainty in policy indicators is at a minimum. Finding the sweet spot in models requires compromises: for example, to include additional component species, the models of each species have in some cases been simplified from age-structured to logistic or bioenergetic models. In this paper, we illuminate the characteristics, capabilities and short-comings of the various modelling approaches being proposed for ecosystem-based fisheries management. We identify key ecosystem needs in fisheries management and indicate which types of models can meet these needs. Ecosystem models have been playing strategic roles by providing an ecosystem context for single-species management decisions. However, conventional stock assessments are being increasingly challenged by changing natural mortality rates and environmentally driven changes in productivity that are observed in many fish stocks. Thus, there is a need for more tactical ecosystem models that can respond dynamically to changing ecological and environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The Bayesian approach to stock assessment determines the probabilities of alternative hypotheses using information for the stock in question and from inferences for other stocks/species. These probabilities are essential if the consequences of alternative management actions are to be evaluated through a decision analysis. Using the Bayesian approach to stock assessment and decision analysis it becomes possible to admit the full range of uncertainty and use the collective historical experience of fisheries science when estimating the consequences of proposed management actions. Recent advances in computing algorithms and power have allowed methods based on the Bayesian approach to be used even for fairly complex stock assessment models and to be within the reach of most stock assessment scientists. However, to avoid coming to ill-founded conclusions, care must be taken when selecting prior distributions. In particular, selection of priors designed to be noninformative with respect to quantities of interest to management is problematic. The arguments of the paper are illustrated using New Zealand's western stock of hoki, Macruronus novaezelandiae (Merlucciidae) and the Bering–Chukchi– Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales as examples.},

They usually calculate the variance of the mean as if the sample were a simple random sample, using the unbiased estimator under this sampling design, that is, $\sigma$2/n. This practice leads to a selection bias, i.e., incorrect inclusion probabilities of population units in the sample are used in the estimator of variance of the mean. The magnitude of the bias varies with the underlying spatial autocorrelation structure. Design-based inference and model-based inference are two conceptual frameworks for tackling estimation of variance of the mean in a systematic sample. This paper reports use of the geostatistical estimation variance $\sigma$(E)/2 with the model-based approach. This variance of the overall spatial mean depends on the spatial autocorrelation structure of the data. We illustrate the method by considering the density of acorns fallen under a sessile oak during one season. Acorns were numbered in square quadrats of 0.25 m2; the data set was exhaustive. We drew nine one-start systematic samples from the whole population of quadrats. We computed semivariograms for the whole population and each sample and fitted them to exponential models without nugget. Using geostatistical theoretical results, we calculated a variance of the mean density of acorns by Monte Carlo integration. We show that our variance estimate depends on (1) the origin of the systematic sample, the central sample being the most accurate, (2) quadrat size, with a decrease in the variance when quadrat size increases, (3) the semivariogram model, (4) discretization of the domain used in Monte Carlo integration, and (5) the random number generator. Considering all sources of variation, the variance estimate we calculated ranged from {\~{}}2 to 36 in our example, for an overall mean equal to 95 acorns per quadrat. Geostatistical variance mainly reflects the locations and size of the sampled quadrats, and the spatial autocorrelation function. In our example, using the variance estimator of a simple random sample leads to a high selection bias. The bias can be neglected only in the absence of significant spatial autocorrelation in the sample. Otherwise, we advocate a geostatistical model-based approach that accounts for spatial autocorrelation.},

The variation in the white noise is attributed to measurement error, or micro-scale variability, and is called the "nugget". We formally establish results on the identifiability and consistency of the nugget in spatial models based upon the Gaussian process within the framework of in-fill asymptotics, i.e. the sample size increases within a sampling domain that is bounded. Our work extends results in fixed domain asymptotics for spatial models without the nugget. More specifically, we establish the identifiability of parameters in the Mat$\backslash$'ern covariance function and the consistency of their maximum likelihood estimators in the presence of discontinuities due to the nugget. We also present simulation studies to demonstrate the role of the identifiable quantities in spatial interpolation.},

abstract = {It is argued that an appropriate model for the evolution of sexual investment, at least in higher vertebrates, may be as follows. The primary sex ratio is fixed at unity, parents can recognise the sex of individual offspring, and the returns (in offspring fitness) are different for the two sexes. For this model, it is shown that it is evolutionarily stable to invest differently in sons and daughters. In particular: i) If for a given investment the probability of survival is lower for one sex, selection favours greater investment in that sex. ii) If one sex has a frequency-dependent com- ponent of fitness, such that individuals receiving a greater-than-average investment are fitter, selection favours greater investment in that sex. iii) If the sex of an offspring can be recognised after an investment d, it may be evolutionarily stable to invest only in some fraction r of the more expen- sive sex, and to abandon a fraction (1 - r). However, such behaviour can evolve only if d is a small fraction of the total investment required per offspring.},

abstract = {Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalised) linear models, (generalised) additive models, smoothing-spline models, state-space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatio-temporal models, log-Gaussian Cox-processes, geostatistical and geoadditive models. In this paper we consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popu-lar subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response vari-ables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form due to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, both in terms of convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified ver-sion, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where MCMC algorithms need hours and days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds and minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison cri-teria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

abstract = {Oyster farming in estuaries is a globally important industry based primarily around the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, for which a common technique is elevated culture on racks, trestles and other structures. We review literature on cultivation impacts, revealing a research focus and state of knowledge that largely parallels that for other aquaculture species and cultivation methods. Ecological studies of elevated culture effects have focused on changes to the benthos from biodeposition, and largely show that impacts are localized and minor by comparison with many other forms of aquaculture. The broader ecological issues associated with elevated oyster culture include the effects of pests (fouling pests, toxic/noxious microalgae, disease), creation of novel habitat (e.g. by fouling of farm structures and accumulation of shell), alteration to nutrient cycling, depletion of suspended particulate matter by oyster crops, and related effects on higher trophic level animals including fish, seabirds and marine mammals. These issues are less well understood for elevated culture systems, but ecological effects can be inferred from the few studies that have been conducted, from other forms of bivalve aquaculture (e.g. mussels), and to some extent from fundamental knowledge of the role of oysters as 'ecosystem engineers'. We use a risk ranking method to evaluate ecological risks (and associated uncertainty intervals) for each of the issues associated with estuarine oyster culture, based on subjective assessment of the likelihood and consequences (severity, spatial extent and duration) of adverse effects. Our assessment reveals that the introduction and spread of pest species are potentially important but often overlooked consequences of oyster cultivation. By comparison with most other sources of impact, the spread of pests by aquaculture activities can occur at regional scales, potentially leading to ecologically significant and irreversible changes to coastal ecosystems. We suggest that future studies of cultivation effects redress the balance of effort by focusing more on these significant issues and less on the effects of biodeposition in isolation. Furthermore, the acceptability of aquaculture operations or new developments should recognize the full range of effects, since adverse impacts may be compensated to some extent by the nominally 'positive' effects of cultivation (e.g. habitat creation), or may be reduced by appropriate planning and management. Even more broadly, aquaculture developments should be considered in relation to other sources of environmental risk and cumulative impacts to estuarine systems at bay-wide or regional scales, so that the effects of cultivation are placed in context. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Aquaculture is viewed as a potential mechanism to meet the growing demand for seafood around the world. The future of bivalve shellfish aquaculture in the U.S. hinges on sustainable practices on the part of industry and a more consistent regulatory regime. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture is a recent practice relative to its history in other countries, beginning in the late 1800s along the U.S. West Coast where it is now well established with farm raised product utilizing land-based hatcheries and grow-out directly in numerous estuaries. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture can be viewed as a disturbance which modifies the estuarine system in three ways: 1) changes in material processes - bivalves process food and produce wastes; 2) addition of physical structure - aquaculture introduces the cultured organisms and in some cases a physical anchoring structure; and 3) pulse disturbances like harvest and bed maintenance disturb sediments, remove species in addition to the cultured organisms themselves, and change resource or habitat availability. In U.S. West Coast estuaries, water column and sediment nutrient concentrations are relatively high and influenced by large tidal exchange and proximity to deeper nearshore ocean waters where upwelling controls production during summer months. Bivalves are unlikely to influence material processes except at local bed scales in these systems, although estuary-wide effects could appear as the fraction of cultured area rises or in poorly flushed bays. Bivalve culture clearly modifies estuarine habitat at local community and at landscape scales and effects are most often evaluated against existing structured habitat in the form of submerged aquatic vegetation. Individual activities act as pulse disturbances and the recovery of eelgrass (Zostera marina) to pre-disturbance levels is variable ({\textless} 2 to {\textgreater} 5 years). The extent of disturbance depends on the aquaculture practice and the distribution of eelgrass reflects a balance of space competition, pulse disturbance and recovery, and is therefore at dynamic equilibrium on aquaculture beds. Structure provided by aquaculture appears functionally similar to eelgrass for small benthic infauna and mobile epibenthic fauna while use of aquaculture as habitat by larger more mobile invertebrates and fish depends on mobility and varies with life-history stage and taxon being evaluated. Scale seems a very important management consideration and further research at estuarine landscape scales, especially for habitat use by important invertebrates and fish, may prove useful in designing and implementing best management practices. Though local and short term effects from aquaculture are clearly evident in U.S. West Coast estuaries, bivalve aquaculture does not remove area from the estuary or degrade water quality like other anthropogenic influences, and thus has not been implicated in shifts to alternate states or reduced adaptive capacity of the larger ecological system.},

We establish that the NNGP is a well-defined spatial process providing legitimate finite-dimensional Gaussian densities with sparse precision matrices. We embed the NNGP as a sparsity-inducing prior within a rich hierarchical modeling framework and outline how computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms can be executed without storing or decomposing large matrices. The floating point operations (flops) per iteration of this algorithm is linear in the number of spatial locations, thereby rendering substantial scalability. We illustrate the computational and inferential benefits of the NNGP over competing methods using simulation studies and also analyze forest biomass from a massive U.S. Forest Inventory dataset at a scale that precludes alternative dimension-reducing methods.

The factors affecting whether abundance will increase within a reserve are well characterized; however, those results are based on long-term equilibria of population models. Here we use age-structured models of a generic fish population to analyze the short-term transient response. We show that it may take decades for a fished population to reach postreserve equilibrium. In the meantime, short-term transient dynamics dominate. During the transient phase, population abundance could either remain unchanged, decrease, or exhibit single-generation oscillations, regardless of the eventual long-term result. Such transient dynamics are longer and more oscillatory for populations with heavier fishing, older ages at maturity, lower natural mortality rates, and lower larval connectivity. We provide metrics based on demographic data to describe the important characteristics of these postreserve transient dynamics.},

abstract = {The recent, rapid development of fishing in Mauritania offers a good case study for a comparative approach of the resilience of the species exploited there, in the face of increasing fishing pressure. First, we assessed the health of 22 demersal stocks with differing ecological requirements, demographic strategies, and states of exploitation. A dynamic production model was fitted in a framework of Bayesian statistics to abundance indices estimated from scientific trawl surveys or commercial catch per unit efforts. We show that 12 of the 22 stocks assessed are overexploited and 3 are fully exploited. The combined assessment of all 22 stocks demonstrates an overall overexploitation, with total demersal biomass decreasing by 75{\%} since 1982 and fishing effort 30{\%} higher than that at maximum sustained yield (40{\%} higher for finfish). Second, relations between states of stocks and life history traits were analysed. The stocks of large and vulnerable species currently undergo the highest fishing pressure and are those that are the most overexploited. At the scale of the community represented by the stocks considered, surveys-based indictors of the mean intrinsic vulnerability, the mean maximum length, and the mean trophic level exhibit a significant decrease from 1990 to 2010. Changes observed in catch-based indicators depend on fishing strategies and are impacted by the recent development of the small-scale fishery. But indicators expressed as a function of a multiplier of fishing effort or fishing mortality clearly decrease, thus confirming that the intensification of exploitation leads to communities dominated by smaller species and lower trophic levels. Weconclude that large and high trophic level species, such as white grouper, meagre, guitarfish, and smooth-hound, are markers of ecosystem health and should be considered as sentinel species.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Bayesian approach to fisheries stock assessment using the delay difference model to describe nonlinear population dynamics. Given a time series of annual catch and effort data, models in the Deriso– Schnute family predict exploitable biomass in the following year from biomass in the current and previous year and from past spawning stock. A state–space model is used, as it allows incorporation of random errors in both the biomass dynamics equations and the observations. Because the biomass dynamics are nonlinear, the common Kalman filter is generally not applicable for parameter estimation. However, it is demonstrated that the Bayesian approach can handle any form of nonlinear relationship in the state and observation equations as well as realistic distributional assumptions. Difficulties with posterior calculations are overcome by the Gibbs sampler in conjunction with the adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling algorithm.},

abstract = {Modeling population dynamics and establishing a comprehensive population assessment for fishery species that are difficult to age have been challenging. Determination of age for such species is still an unresolved issue or is at best uncertain. Catch-survey analysis does not require full age information but can still provide a comprehensive population assessment. It was extended to incorporate multiple surveys and multiple sources of uncertainties within the statistical catch-at-age framework in the applications to crustaceans. Here, we further generalize and extend the multiple survey catch-survey analysis into a hierarchical Bayesian two-stage model by applying the hierarchical Bayesian approach. The hierarchical Bayesian approach can sufficiently incorporate uncertainty and expert opinions in parameter estimation. We developed a series of models with different assumptions for natural mortality and catchability, including nonstationary (i.e., time-varying) assumptions. We evaluated model robustness to these assumptions and compared population dynamics estimates and population status determination. We demonstrated the application of the hierarchical Bayesian two-stage model using the North Carolina blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) example. In this example, estimation of population size and fishing mortality and determination of population status were robust to the natural mortality and catchability assumptions. The North Carolina blue crab population is less likely to have nonstationary catchability or nonstationary natural mortality. Its natural mortality is more likely to vary by stage than by sex or over time.},

abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest ("derived quantities") are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional "plug-in" estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new "epsilon" estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},

The process of change which will be found in termi-nal portions of the frequency distribution curve is especially important in this connection, so that a precise analysis of it will be undertaken. Through this analysis the reader will be led to new concepts of " quasi-fixation " and " quasi-loss '' of an allele. Comparison of this process with that of random drift due to small population number is another important subject in the present report. Though there are many theoretical studies on the process of random drift, they are usually restricted to the state that will be realized after a sufficient number of generations. In that state the distribution curve assumes a fixed form and the probabilities of all heterallelic classes decrease at a constant rate of 1/2N, with fixation and loss of the gene occurring at the same rate. Hence more extensive studies may be needed to make such a comparison. In the present paper an asymptotic solution for the process of random drift due to small population number will be presented for the first time.},

We propose using AIC intervals based on fitting the full observational model for comparing different observational likelihoods.

abstract = {When assessing the status of a fish population for advising management, the spawner-recruit (S-R) relationship, which represents stock productivity, is an important biological process to consider, including the extent to which environmental drivers should be explicitly accounted for in recruitment estimation. Fishery managers are increasingly making requests for analysts to investigate the utility of including environmental data in stock assessment applications. Consequently, research is needed that addresses both specific environmental processes that may influence stock parameters and robust methods for including such data in the assessment. Two methods for incorporating environmental information in an integrated assessment model were evaluated in this study, based on: 1) including an environmental covariate as an additional component of the S-R function; or 2) using the covariate outside the S-R relationship as a survey index of recruitment. The methods were implemented in a broadly employed stock assessment software package (Stock Synthesis) using population/fishery processes generally applicable to an exploited small pelagic fish species (Pacific sardine). Simulation analysis was used to examine how environment-recruitment considerations in the assessment influenced model performance. The quality (bias and precision) of estimates of abundance and derived quantities generated from the models were examined statistically. Findings indicated that both methods for including an environmental index in the model resulted in relatively high quality estimates for a diverse group of output variables, depending on assumptions regarding bias correction and penalties associated with the recruitment deviation estimates. Several estimated quantities were found to be generally unbiased and relatively precise (e.g., stock biomass and average recruitment), regardless of the method implemented in the model; whereas, the choice of the method did impact the quality of results associated with more sensitive quantities (e.g., virgin recruitment and depletion). Recommendations for approaches based on both methods, as well as practical considerations associated with the methods are discussed.},

Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Tracking of marine animals has increased exponentially in the past decade, and the resulting data could lead to an in-depth understanding of the causes and consequences of movement in the ocean. However, most common marine tracking systems are associated with large measurement errors. Accounting for these errors requires the use of hierarchical models, which are often difficult to fit to data. Using 3 case studies, we demonstrate that Template Model Builder (TMB), a new R package, is an accurate, efficient and flexible framework for modelling movement data. First, to demonstrate that TMB is as accurate but 30 times faster than bsam, a popular R package used to apply state-space models to Argos data, we modelled polar bear $\backslash$textit{\{}Ursus maritimus{\}} Argos data and compared the locations estimated by the models to GPS locations of these same bears. Second, to demonstrate how TMBs gain in efficiency and frequentist framework facilitate model comparison, we developed models with different error structures and compared them to find the most effective model for light-based geolocations of rhinoceros auklets $\backslash$textit{\{}Cerorhinca monocerata{\}}. Finally, to maximize efficiency through TMBs use of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood, we modelled behavioural changes with continuous rather than discrete states. This new model directly accounts for the irregular sampling intervals characteristic of Fastloc-GPS data of grey seals $\backslash$textit{\{}Halichoerus grypus{\}}. Using real and simulated data, we show that TMB is a fast and powerful tool for modelling marine movement data. We discuss how TMBs potential reaches beyond marine movement studies.},

abstract = {Index-based stock assessments often use time series smoothing to reduce estimation error in their output. However, this may increase error if actual changes in the population are masked by the smoothing. Therefore, it is important to understand how smoothing assessment output will affect estimation accuracy under conditions commonly observed in fish survey time series. Here, we simulated the Georges Bank yellowtail flounder survey time series and assessment in which three bottom trawl surveys are used to estimate the state of the population. We compared the accuracy of the assessment output when it is unsmoothed versus when is smoothed by applying a three-year moving average to the output index. We did so for two estimation models: the currently used empirical assessment model, and a multivariate state-space random walk model. We simulated five biomass trends under two drivers, and examined model performance when one, two, or three surveys were used to fit the model. Overall, the unsmoothed state-space model consistently outperformed the other methods, particularly when there was a rapid change in biomass in the final years, and all three surveys were used to fit the model. The benefit of using the unsmoothed estimate also increased with the underlying rate of change in the population. The advantage gained by using the unsmoothed estimate also increased as additional surveys were used to fit the model. The benefit of using the state-space model versus the empirical model was similar to the benefit of using the unsmoothed versus smoothed estimate. Our results suggest that an unsmoothed state-space model should be used when multiple survey time series are available and population biomass appears to be rapidly changing in recent years.},

Two simulation studies are presented that show that the fixed-domain asymptotic properties can explain some finite-sample behavior of both interpolation and estimation when the sample size is moderately large. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Statistical Association.},

abstract = {A population can adapt to a rapid environmental change or habitat expansion in two ways. It may adapt either through new beneficial mutations that subsequently sweep through the population or by using alleles from the standing genetic variation. We use diffusion theory to calculate the probabilities for selective adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation probability for weak substitutions, if alleles originate from the standing genetic variation. We then determine the parameter regions where each scenario-standing variation vs. new mutations-is more likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation are favored if either the selective advantage is weak or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of "soft sweeps," where multiple copies of the selected allele contribute to a substitution, and discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps with weaker selective footprints are likely under both scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection coefficient is high.},

abstract = {An empirical analysis of the spatial distribution of long-term mean seasonal and annual rainfall in Hunter Valley for the period 1901-1975 is presented. Isohyet maps were derived, using a recently developed method, from Laplacian smoothing spline surfaces fitted to rainfall data at 203 stations. The surface fitting method represents a substantial improvement over previously available subjective, least squares polynomial and weighted interpolation methods. The smoothing spline surfaces are functions of latitude, longitude, and elevation, with the degree of data smoothing determined by minimizing the generalized cross validation (GCV). The method does not require prior standardization of short-term means to long-term means, affords error estimates, and permits testing of the validity of the fitted model. The fitted rainfall surfaces estimate long-term mean annual rainfall at any point in the valley with a percentage r.m.s. predictive error of 9.2{\%} and estimate long-term mean seasonal amounts at any point with percentage r.m.s. predictive errors ranging from 11.9{\%} in winter to 18.2{\%} in summer.},

abstract = {Temporal changes in demography, population sustainability, and harvest rates support the hypothesis that overexploitation precipitated the commercial extinction of northern cod, Gadus rnorhua, off Newfoundland and Labrador in 1992. Annual estimates of realized population growth (r) indicate that the stock was rarely sustainable at the age-specific survival and fecundity rates experienced since 1962. A twofold decline in annual survival probabilities in the 1980s was concomitant with increased inshore and off- shore fishing effort, declining catch rate, and spatial shifts in gillnetting effort from areas of low (inshore) to high (offshore) catch rates. We reject hypotheses that attribute the collapse of northern cod to envi- ronmental change. Water temperature was associated neither with juvenile nor adult abundance nor with adult distribution by depth. Harvests equivalent to those of the past decade were sustainable in the nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries in a considerably colder environment. An updated analysis of previous work indicates that salinity has little effect on recruitment. We conclude that the collapse of northern cod can be attributed solely to overexploitation and that population sustainability indices such as r pro- vide a means by which the susceptibility and resilience of exploited populations can be assessed and their probability of cesmrnercial extinction reduced.},

abstract = {The evolution of sex is one of the most important and controversial problems in evolutionary biology. Although sex is almost universal in higher animals and plants, its inherent costs have made its maintenance difficult to explain. The most famous of these is the twofold cost of males, which can greatly reduce the fecundity of a sexual population, compared to a population of asexual females. Over the past century, multiple hypotheses, along with experimental evidence to support these, have been put forward to explain widespread costly sex. In this review, we outline some of the most prominent theories, along with the experimental and observational evidence supporting these. Historically, there have been 4 classes of theories: the ability of sex to fix multiple novel advantageous mutants (Fisher-Muller hypothesis); sex as a mechanism to stop the build-up of deleterious mutations in finite populations (Muller's ratchet); recombination creating novel genotypes that can resist infection by parasites (Red Queen hypothesis); and the ability of sex to purge bad genomes if deleterious mutations act synergistically (mutational deterministic hypothesis). Current theoretical and experimental evidence seems to favor the hypothesis that sex breaks down selection interference between new mutants, or it acts as a mechanism to shuffle genotypes in order to repel parasitic invasion. However, there is still a need to collect more data from natural populations and experimental studies, which can be used to test different hypotheses.},

abstract = {Population connectivity plays significant roles on both evolutionary and ecological time-scales; however, quantifying the magnitude and pattern of exchange between populations of marine organisms is hindered by the difficulty of tracking the trajectory and fate of propagules. We explored biophysical correlates of population substructure to determine how well pelagic larval duration (PLD) correlates with population genetic estimates of connectivity in a sample of 300 published studies drawn pseudo-randomly from about 1600 hits on electronic searches. In direct contrast to the general expectation of a strong correlation, we find that average PLD is poorly correlated (r2{\textless}0.1) with genetic structure (FST). Furthermore, even this weak correlation is anchored by non-pelagic dispersal, because removal of the zero PLD class (direct developers) from the analysis resulted in a non-significant relationship between FST and PLD. For species in which minimum, maximum, and mean PLDs were available, it is noteworthy that both minimum and maximum PLDs are better correlated with FST than the mean larval duration, which has been used in all such previous studies. A 3-way ANCOVA reveals that genetic marker class (allozymes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial DNA sequences), as opposed to habitat or swimming ability, explain most of the variation in FST (F=7.113, df=2, p=0.001), with higher values of FST obtained from mtDNA than with either microsatellites or allozymes (which were not sig- nificantly different). Our meta-analysis refutes recent reviews and conventional wisdom that PLD is a good predictor of the magnitude of gene flow and geographic scale of population structure in marine systems.},

abstract = {The characteristics of a persistent gyre in the mouth of the Bay of Fundy are studied using model simulations. A set of climatological runs are conducted to evaluate the relative importance of the different forcing mechanisms affecting the gyre. The main mechanisms are tidal rectification and density-driven circulation. Stronger circulation of the gyre occurs during the later part of the stratified season (July-August and September-October). The density-driven flow around the gyre is set up by weak tidal mixing in the deep basin in the central Bay of Fundy and strong tidal mixing on the shallow flanks around Grand Manan Island and western Nova Scotia. Spring river discharge has an important influence on near-surface circulation but only a small effect when averaged over the entire water column. Retention of particles in the gyre is controlled by the residual tidal circulation, increased frontal retention during stratified periods, wind stress, and interactions with the adjacent circulation of the Gulf of Maine. Residence times longer than 30 days are predicted for particles released in the proximity of the gyre. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

They are used to prioritize management interventions and assess tradeoffs, serving as an essential component of ecosystem‐based management (). A central objective of most risk assessments for conservation and management is to characterize uncertainty and impacts associated with one or more pressures of interest. Risk assessments have been used in marine resource management to help evaluate the risk of environmental, ecological, and anthropogenic pressures on species or habitats including for data‐poor fisheries management (e.g., toxicity, probability of extinction, habitat alteration impacts). Traditionally, marine risk assessments focused on singular pressure‐response relationships, but recent advancements have included use of risk assessments in an context, providing a method for evaluating the cumulative impacts of multiple pressures on multiple ecosystem components. Here, we describe a conceptual framework for ecosystem risk assessment (), highlighting its role in operationalizing, with specific attention to ocean management considerations. This framework builds on the ecotoxicological and conservation literature on risk assessment and includes recent advances that focus on risks posed by fishing to marine ecosystems. We review how examples of s from the United States fit into this framework, explore the variety of analytical approaches that have been used to conduct s, and assess the challenges and data gaps that remain. This review discusses future prospects for s as decision‐support tools, their expanded role in integrated ecosystem assessments, and the development of next‐generation risk assessments for coupled natural–human systems.},

@article{Caddy1995,
abstract = {This paper reviews the conceptual background and application of technical reference points in fishery management. Despite considerable investment in stock assessment methodology and expertise, fisheries worldwide are overexploited. This appears to be due to a mismatch between the precision of assessment and the precision of management. Two types of reference points are recognized: target reference points (TRPs) and limit reference points (LRPs). The use of MSY as a target reference point is considered in the light of past performance of fishery management, and it is suggested that MSY and other reference points formerly used as targets, may be more appropriately applied as LRPs. The recent trend towards the quantification of uncertainty and estimation of risk in the provision of advice is considered to be good, but the cost and availability of information and expertise required may preclude the use of these techniques for many small or low value stocks and for most stocks in developing countries. The recent trend towards inclusion of ‘ecosystem concepts' in setting fishery management objectives is also seen as good, and overdue. Although still in their formative stages, ecosystem concepts can still provide LRPs. Effective management will require a ‘set of rules' comprising both TRPs and LRPs. In most national and international fishery management situations, the current institutional structure will probably require some modification in order to successfully apply these sets of rules. Fisheries management organizations will continue to assess and manage fisheries routinely, but management may need to develop an independent review which comes into play when resource production limits are approached. The action to be taken at such limits should be discussed and agreed in advance.},

abstract = {Stock assessments based on the integrated paradigm often include an underlying stock-recruitment relationship. This, along with estimates of fishery selectivity and biological parameters, allows the biomass and fishing mortality associated with Maximum Sustainable Yield (BMSY and FMSY respectively) to be calculated. However, the estimates of these quantities may differ from the proxies assumed in the harvest control rules that are used to provide management advice. Moreover, the estimated values for BMSY and FMSY are related functionally in population dynamics models based on 2-parameter stock-recruitment relationships such as the commonly used Beverton-Holt or Ricker relationships. Use of 2-parameter stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs) consequently restricts the ability to fully quantify the uncertainty associated with estimating BMSY and FMSY because 2-parameter SRRs restrict the potential range of values for BMSY/B0. In principle, BMSY/B0 and FMSY can be more independent if the stock-recruitment relationship is more general than these 2-parameter SRRs. This paper outlines eleven potential 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationships and evaluates them in terms of whether they are able to match a wide range of specifications for BMSY (expressed relative to unfished spawning stock biomass, B0) and FMSY (expressed relative to natural mortality, M). Of the eleven 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationships considered, the Ricker-Power stock-recruitment relationship is found to best satisfy the characteristics of (a) being able to mimic a wide range of BMSY/B0 and FMSY/M values, (b) not to lead to negative recruitment for biomasses between 0 and B0, and (c) not to lead to increasing recruitment while approaching the limit of zero population size. Bayesian assessments of three example groundfish species off the US west coast (aurora rockfish, petrale sole, and cabezon) are conducted using Simple Stock Synthesis based on the Beverton-Holt and Ricker-Power stock-recruitment relationships to illustrate some of the impacts of allowing for a 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationship.},

This article develops a class of highly scalable nearest-neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) models to provide fully model-based inference for large geostatistical datasets. We establish that the NNGP is a well-defined spatial process providing legitimate finite-dimensional Gaussian densities with sparse precision matrices. We embed the NNGP as a sparsity-inducing prior within a rich hierarchical modeling framework and outline how computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms can be executed without storing or decomposing large matrices. The floating point operations (flops) per iteration of this algorithm is linear in the number of spatial locations, thereby rendering substantial scalability. We illustrate the computational and inferential benefits of the NNGP over competing methods using simulation studies and also analyze forest biomass from a massive U.S. Forest Inventory dataset at a scale that precludes alternative dimension-reducing methods.

abstract = {Understanding spatial patterns of species diversity and the distributions of individual species is a consuming problem in biogeography and conservation. The Cape floristic region of South Africa is a global hot spot of diversity and endemism, and the Protea atlas project, with about 60000 site records across the region, provides an extraordinarily rich data set to model patterns of biodiversity. Model development is focused spatially at the scale of 1′ grid cells (about 37000 cells total for the region). We report on results for 23 species of a flowering plant family known as Proteaceae (of about 330 in the Cape floristic region) for a defined subregion. Using a Bayesian framework, we developed a two-stage, spatially explicit, hierarchical logistic regression. Stage 1 models the potential probability of presence or absence for each species at each cell, given species attributes, grid cell (site level) environmental data with species level coefficients, and a spatial random effect. The second level of the hierarchy models the probability of observing each species in each cell given that it is present. Because the atlas data are not evenly distributed across the landscape, grid cells contain variable numbers of sampling localities. Thus this model takes the sampling intensity at each site into account by assuming that the total number of times that a particular species was observed within a site follows a binomial distribution. After assigning prior distributions to all quantities in the model, samples from the posterior distribution were obtained via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Results are mapped as the model-estimated probability of presence for each species across the domain. This provides an alternative to customary empirical 'range-of-occupancy' displays. Summing yields the predicted richness of species over the region. Summaries of the posterior for each environmental coefficient show which variables are most important in explaining the presence of species. Our initial results describe biogeographical patterns over the modelled region remarkably well. In particular, species local population size and mode of dispersal contribute significantly to predicting patterns, along with annual precipitation, the coefficient of variation in rainfall and elevation.},

abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Darwinian explanation for evolution is that it is the outcome of the interaction between genetic variation and natural selection. There is now good evidence for both the existence of genetic variation and the occurrence of natural selection, the latter potentially at high intensities. The outcome should be rapid evolutionary change; yet in practice very little change is found. Most species are very stable, and in situations where evolution is observed in one species often none is found in others despite equivalent opportunity. Evolutionary failure is commonplace. Despite the occurrence of high levels of protein polymorphism, there is good evidence that the supply of variation making a major contribution to fitness is very limited. As a result it is argued that lack of evolution in most species may be due more to lack of appropriate variability than to other causes: a condition for which the term 'genostasis' is proposed. In those situations where appropriate genetic variation is available for one reason or another, evolution is found to be very rapid. There are good theoretical and practical reasons for more attention being paid to the mechanisms of supply of new variation and to those situations where evolution appears not be taking place.},

Predictive modeling can show how management can influence those dynamics and structures and the ecosystem services these systems provide.

Atlantis is an end-to-end ecosystem model that is well suited for this task and has so far been developed for more than 30 diverse marine ecosystems worldwide. To provide a better understanding of the current modeling work, elicit wider interest, and foster collaboration within the Atlantis community, the first international Atlantis Summit was convened in December 2015. The main outcomes from this workshop included a clearer framework and infrastructure for model development and collaboration; the opportunity to perform common scenarios with a range of Atlantis models to analyze ecosystem responses to environmental and management-based perturbations; and the use of Atlantis as a test case for exploring the performance of single species, multispecies, and trophic food web models at an international level.},

In contrast, women – even in high mortality hunter-gatherer populations – usually remain healthy and productive well beyond menopause. The grandmother hypothesis aims to account for the evolution of this distinctive feature of human life history. Our previous mathematical simulations of that hypothesis fixed the end of female fertility at the age of 45, based on the similarities among living hominids, and then modeled the evolution of human-like longevity from an ancestral state, like that of the great apes, due only to grandmother effects. A major modification here allows the age female fertility ends to vary as well, directly addressing a version of the question, influentially posed by GC Williams six decades ago: Why isn't menopause later in humans? Our model is an agent-based model (ABM) that accounts for the coevolution of both expected adult lifespan and end of female fertility as selection maximizes reproductive value. We find that grandmother effects not only drive the population from an equilibrium representing a great ape-like longevity to a new human-like longevity, they also maintain the observed termination of women's fertility before the age of 50.},

abstract = {Various software for Geographical Information Systems (GISs) have been developed and used in many different engineering projects. In GIS applications, map coverage is important in terms of performing reliable and meaningful queries. Map projections can be conformal, equal-area and equidistant. The goal of an application plays an important role in choosing one of those projections. Choosing the equal-area projection for an application in which area information is used (forestry, agriculture, ecosystem etc) reduces the amount of distortion on the area, but many users using GIS ignore this fact and continue to use applications with present map sheets no matter in what map projection it is. For example, extracting area information from data whose country system's map sheet is in conformal projection is relatively more distorted, compared to an equal-area projection one. The goal of this study is to make the best decision in choosing the most proper equal-area projection among the choices provided by ArcGIS 9.0, which is a popular GIS software package, and making a comparison on area errors when conformal projection is used. In this study, the area of parcels chosen in three different regions and geographic coordinates and whose sizes vary between 0.01 to 1,000,000 ha are calculated according to Transversal Mercator (TM, 3°), Universal Transversal Mercator (UTM, 6°) and 14 different equal-area projections existing in the ArcGIS 9.0 GIS software package. The parcel areas calculated with geographical coordinates are accepted as definite. The difference between the sizes calculated according to projection coordinates and real sizes of the parcels are determined. Consequently, the appropriate projections are decided for the areas smaller and equal than 1,000 ha and greater than 1,000 ha in the GIS software package.},

abstract = {We compiled 297 series of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and independent abundance data (as estimated by research trawl surveys) and used observation error and random effects models to test the hypothesis that CPUE is proportional to true abundance. We used a power curve, for which we were interested in the shape parameter ($\beta$). There was little difference among species, ages, or gear types in the distributions of the raw estimates of $\beta$ for each CPUE series. We examined three groups: cod, flatfish, and gadiformes, finding strong evidence that CPUE was most likely to remain high while abundance declines (i.e., hyperstability, where $\beta$ {\textless} 1). The range in the mean of the random effects distribution for $\beta$ was quite small, 0.64-0.75. Cod showed the least hyperstability, but still, 76{\%} of the mass of the random effects distribution was below 1. Based on simulations, our estimates of $\beta$ are positively biased by approximately 10{\%}; this should be considered in the application of our findings here. We also considered the precision of CPUE indices through a meta-analysis of observation error variances. The most precise indices were those from flatfish (median coefficient of variation of ≈0.42).},

Results of the study indicate that while the use of these closed-containment systems may reduce the local ecological impacts typically associated with net-pen salmon farming, the increase in material and energy demands associated with their use may result in significantly increased contributions to several environmental impacts of global concern, including global warming, non-renewable resource depletion, and acidification. It is recommended that these unanticipated impacts be carefully considered in further assessments of the sustainability of closed-containment systems and in ongoing efforts to develop and employ these technologies on a larger scale. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Genetic perturbations include intense directional selection and certain specific genes. Environmental perturbations include temperature extremes in particular, protein deprivation, audiogenic stress, and exposure to pollutants. (3) There is a negative association between FA and heterozygosity in a range of taxa especially fish, a result consistent with FA being a measure of fitness.

FA tends to increase as habitats become ecologically marginal; this includes exposure to environmental toxicants. (5) In our own species, FA of an increasing range of traits has been related to both environmental and genomic stress. (6) Domestication increases FA of the strength of homologous long bones of vertebrate species due to a relaxation of natural selection.

Direct measurements of passage survival and transportation were not always available, so instead, the researchers attempted to tease out the passage or transportation effects by using trends in production estimated from SR models. Small subsets of data, or even single observations, highly influenced the estimates of passage survival and transportation effectiveness derived from these models. For stream-type chinook salmon, deleting 1 of 13 stocks changed the estimate of main-stem passage survival from 11 to 34{\%}. For ocean-type chinook salmon, the conclusion that transportation should be immediately halted hinged on a single observation. The Snake River salmon SR models starkly illustrate the importance of using influence diagnostics to temper inferences.},

Overall, rates of resource collapse increased and recovery potential, stability, and water quality decreased exponentially with declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity, in contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21{\%}, on average. We conclude that marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from perturbations.

Stable isotope analyses ($\delta$13Cand $\delta$15N) of the same fish suggested that this difference in growth rate is associated with a change in trophic position. Although salinity was low (0–5 ppt), the $\delta$13C values of fish from the oligohaline region (–21.3 to –23‰) suggest that a significant part of their diet may be derived from marine-like sources. All $\delta$15N values for juvenile striped bass were high relative to previously published $\delta$15N values for freshwater and marine fish and are suggestive of inputs of sewage-derived nitrogen. Fish from the oligohaline region ($\delta$15N values of 16–20.6‰) may occupy a lower trophic level than fish collected further upstream ($\delta$15N values of 22.4–26.4‰) based on the difference between the $\delta$15N of fish and literature values for particulate organic matter collected in the same area and season.

Over the last few hundred years, human beings have steadily increased the rate of species' extinction, by perhaps 2 or 3 orders of magnitude above ‘background' rates. Looking ahead, and by a variety of calculations, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that extinction rates over the next 100 years will be at least 4 orders of magnitude faster than background rates in the fossil record (Lawton and May, 1995). Such rates of extinction may be unprecedented in the history of life on Earth.},

abstract = {Seagrass beds are of exceptional economic, ecological and social value in the Coral Triangle. The large number of people who live close to the coast and rely directly on marine resources for food and income paradoxically increases the value of, but also the threats to, these ecosystems. A key strategy of the Coral Triangle Initiative is to protect shallow coastal ecosystems through the design and implementation of resilient networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). This strategy requires accurate spatial data on the distribution and extent of coastal habitats (coral reef, seagrass and mangrove) at scales which match conservation planning decisions. In the Coral Triangle, seagrass distribution maps are not readily available at ecoregional scales. The Lesser Sunda ecoregion, extending from Bali, Indonesia to Timor-Leste, is one of 11 ecoregions of the Coral Triangle and a high priority for conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. To support the design of a resilient MPA network for the Lesser Sunda ecoregion, a seagrass distribution map was generated based on Landsat imagery, literature review and groundtruth data. Seagrass beds were estimated to cover an area of 273km2at an overall accuracy of 78{\%}. Use of the seagrass distribution map in the MPA design improved the habitat representation and connectivity - key criteria for resilient MPA design. The final MPA design included 80km2of seagrass beds, with more than half the beds adjacent to coral reefs and mangroves. This study demonstrates the effective use of Landsat imagery and remote sensing techniques to derive ecoregional scale seagrass maps supporting MPA network design. •First consistent ecoregional scale seagrass map for the Lesser Sunda Ecoregion.•Capabilities of remote sensing for seagrass quality data maps at relevant scales.•Case-study: map was instrumental to identify potential conservation priority sites.•Methods can be replicated worldwide for large-scales and data deficient scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{F.Dormann2007,
abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

abstract = {A milestone may be near. After growing steadily, particularly in the last four decades, aquaculture is for the first time set to contribute half of the fish consumed by the human population worldwide. This reflects not only the vitality of the aquaculture sector but also global economic growth and continuing developments in fish processing and trade. Until a year or so ago, the production trends in aquaculture and capture fisheries were continuing without any drastic modification to those already in place at the start of this decade. The capture fisheries sector was regularly producing between 90 and 95 million tonnes per year, and aquaculture production was growing rapidly, albeit at a gradually declining rate. However, the substantial increases in energy and food prices, which started in 2007 and have continued into 2008, as well as the threat of climate change, mean that the conditions for capture fisheries and aquaculture are changing. That said, the combined effects of rising prices and climate change are complex, and they affect a very large number of fisheries and aquaculture operations in a mosaic of natural, social and economic contexts. Hence, it is too early to have a clear understanding of the cumulative impact worldwide on fisheries and aquaculture. Nonetheless, it is clear that there will be both winners and losers among fishers, aquaculturists and those employed in ancillary industries. On the one hand, rising prices for staple foods will also cause an increase in the price of many fish and fish products, and this will stimulate all in the sector to produce more. However, those who capture or culture fish, or other aquatic animals, using energy-intensive forms of production may find recent cost increases prohibitive. They may well face difficulties in continuing in their occupation, at least in the immediate future. On the other hand, low-intensity aquaculture and most small-scale and artisanal fisheries will attempt to expand production. This will increase the importance of improved governance in both aquaculture and low-energy-consuming fisheries (some near-shore fisheries, passive fishing gear, etc.). This issue of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture features some of the aspects of fisheries and aquaculture that may receive increasing attention. Among these aspects are climate change, the use of marine genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and the proliferation of private standards and certification schemes in the international fish trade. This issue also highlights a few of FAOs special studies. These include the use of wild-fishery resources as seed and feed in aquaculture, and reviews of the worlds shrimp fisheries and of the management of marine capture fisheries in the Pacific Ocean. The format of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture remains unchanged. As with previous editions, this issue contains a CDROM with the World Fisheries and Aquaculture Atlas.},

abstract = {We analyzed tag returns from a long-term tagging program to evaluate the movement patterns of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River (AR) stock of Striped Bass (Morone saxati-lis) during a period of stock recovery in 1991-2008. The AR stock was found to increase its movement outside the Albemarle Sound estuary (from {\textless}4{\%} to 15-31{\%}) as it recovered from 1991 to 2008. Analysis with multinomial lo-gistic regression where recapture area was modeled as a function of fish size and stock abundance indicated that Striped Bass from the AR stock exhibit a strong size-dependent emigration pattern. Larger (older) adults {\textgreater}600 mm in total length (TL) were much more likely to emigrate to ocean habitats (after spawning) than were smaller adults (350-600 mm TL), which mostly remained in inshore estuarine habi-tats. Smaller adults showed evidence of density-dependent movement and were recaptured only in adjacent es-tuarine systems, the Pamlico Sound and lower Chesapeake Bay, during periods of increased stock abundance. Assessment and management strate-gies for the AR stock of Striped Bass could be improved by accounting for movement (and hence harvest) outside the currently assumed stock bound-ary. More broadly, this study illustrates that changes in the demographics, such as size structure and total abundance, within fish populations can result in major shifts in their distribution and that long-term tagging data are useful in detection of such population-level changes in movement patterns.},

Second, the “idealist” and “typological” structuralist theories of the time were not particularly anti-evolutionary. Typological theories provided argumentation and evidence that was crucial to the refutation of Natural Theological creationism. The contrast between functionalist and structuralist approaches to biology continues today, and the historical misunderstanding of 19th century typological biology may be one of its effects.

The results are fully validated using instrumental data. We also analyze the result sensitivity to the open boundary conditions. We find that using boundary conditions from a baroclinic reanalysis, reproducing a wide range of physical processes, does not give more accurate results than a barotropic reanalysis, reproducing storm surge and astronomical tides, the main forcings at the study area. This analysis also leads us to address the importance of the temporal extent in the databases used for MRE applications. Finally, the generated hindcast is used to analyze normal and extreme currents and sea level regimes in BiMEP, following the internationally accepted standards for the design of MRE converters. The generated database offers MRE converter developers an alternative to the often-proposed empirical formulae for the definition of the design cases to consider in the loads and safety analysis of their devices.},

@article{Fletcher2005,
abstract = {We discuss a method for analyzing data that are positively skewed and contain a substantial proportion of zeros. Such data commonly arise in ecological applications, when the focus is on the abundance of a species. The form of the distribution is then due to the patchy nature of the environment and/or the inherent heterogeneity of the species. The method can be used whenever we wish to model the data as a response variable in terms of one or more explanatory variables. The analysis consists of three stages. The first involves creating two sets of data from the original: one shows whether or not the species is present; the other indicates the logarithm of the abundance when it is present. These are referred to as the 'presence data' and the 'log-abundance' data, respectively. The second stage involves modelling the presence data using logistic regression, and separately modelling the log-abundance data using ordinary regression. Finally, the third stage involves combining the two models in order to estimate the expected abundance for a specific set of values of the explanatory variables. A common approach to analyzing this sort of data is to use a ln (y + c) transformation, where c is some constant (usually one). The method we use here avoids the need for an arbitrary choice of the value of c, and allows the modelling to be carried out in a natural and straightforward manner, using well-known regression techniques. The approach we put forward is not original, having been used in both conservation biology and fisheries. Our objectives in this paper are to (a) promote the application of this approach in a wide range of settings and (b) suggest that parametric bootstrapping be used to provide confidence limits for the estimate of expected abundance. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

abstract = {Hemes (iron porphyrins) are involved in a range of functions in biology, including electron transfer, small-molecule binding and transport, and O2 activation. The delocalization of the Fe d-electrons into the porphyrin ring and its effect on the redox chemistry and reactivity of these systems has been difficult to study by optical spectroscopies due to the dominant porphyrin pi--{\textgreater}pi(*) transitions, which obscure the metal center. Recently, we have developed a methodology that allows for the interpretation of the multiplet structure of Fe L-edges in terms of differential orbital covalency (i.e., differences in mixing of the d-orbitals with ligand orbitals) using a valence bond configuration interaction (VBCI) model. Applied to low-spin heme systems, this methodology allows experimental determination of the delocalization of the Fe d-electrons into the porphyrin (P) ring in terms of both P--{\textgreater}Fe sigma and pi-donation and Fe--{\textgreater}P pi back-bonding. We find that pi-donation to Fe(III) is much larger than pi back-bonding from Fe(II), indicating that a hole superexchange pathway dominates electron transfer. The implications of the results are also discussed in terms of the differences between heme and non-heme oxygen activation chemistry.},

abstract = {Larval dispersal is the key process by which populations of most marine fishes and invertebrates are connected and replenished. Advances in larval tagging and genetics have enhanced our capacity to track larval dispersal, assess scales of population connectivity, and quantify larval exchange among no-take marine reserves and fished areas. Recent studies have found that reserves can be a significant source of recruits for populations up to 40 km away, but the scale and direction of larval connectivity across larger seascapes remain unknown. Here, we apply genetic parentage analysis to investigate larval dispersal patterns for two exploited coral reef groupers (Plectropomus maculatus and Plectropomus leopardus) within and among three clusters of reefs separated by 60–220 km within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. A total of 69 juvenile P. maculatus and 17 juvenile P. leopardus (representing 6{\%} and 9{\%} of the total juveniles sampled, respectively) were genetically assigned to parent individuals on reefs within the study area. We identified both short-distance larval dispersal within regions (200 m to 50 km) and long-distance, multidirectional dispersal of up to {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}250 km among regions. Dispersal strength declined significantly with distance, with best-fit dispersal kernels estimating median dispersal distances of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}110 km for P. maculatus and {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}190 km for P. leopardus. Larval exchange among reefs demonstrates that established reserves form a highly connected network and contribute larvae for the replenishment of fished reefs at multiple spatial scales. Our findings highlight the potential for long-distance dispersal in an important group of reef fishes, and provide further evidence that effectively protected reserves can yield recruitment and sustainability benefits for exploited fish populations.},

abstract = {Many important ecological questions require accounting for spatial variation in demographic rates (e.g., survival) and population variables (e.g., abundance per unit area). However, ecologists have few spatial modelling approaches that (i) fit directly to spatially referenced data, (ii) represent population dynamics explicitly and mechanistically, and (iii) estimate parameters using rigorous statistical methods. We therefore demonstrate a new and computationally efficient approach to spatial modelling that uses random fields in place of the random variables typically used in spatially aggregated models. We adapt this approach to delay-difference dynamics to estimate the impact of fishing and natural mortality, recruitment, and individual growth on spatial population dynamics for a fish population. In particular, we develop this approach to estimate spatial variation in average production of juvenile fishes (termed recruitment), as well as annual variation in the spatial distribution of recruitment. We first use a simulation experiment to demonstrate that the spatial delay-difference model can, in some cases, explain over 50{\%} of spatial variance in recruitment. We also apply the spatial delay-difference model to data for rex sole (Glyptocephalus zachirus) in the Gulf of Alaska and show that average recruitment (across all years) is greatest near Kodiak Island but that some years show greatest recruitment in Southeast Alaska or the western Gulf of Alaska. Using model developments and software advances presented here, we argue that future research can develop models to approximate adult movement, incorporate spatial covariates to explain annual variation in recruitment, and evaluate management procedures that use spatially explicit estimates of population abundance.},

abstract = {The macrotidal Bay of Fundy, Canada, was systematically mapped in the early 2000s using multibeam sonar technology, partly to support efforts to develop hydropower. The primary product was a suite of 1:50,000-scale maps of shaded seafloor relief and backscatter. In addition, a 'seascape' map was produced in an attempt to classify the entire bay in terms of morphology, texture, and biota. The eight seascape groups that are delineated reflect the strong signature of glaciation in much of the bay, the effects of Holocene tidal range expansion, and the results of modern processes under a dynamic current regime. As a result of the recent mapping we are able to argue that the muddy depocentre in the southwest of the bay was primarily active before the well-documented expansion of tidal range that occurred in the Bay of Fundy in the Holocene epoch. We further demonstrate the complexity of the seafloor in one of the glacial seascapes, and discuss the morphology and stability of a major tidal scour. The evidence obtained from multibeam sonar mapping reveals the complexity of the sea floor in the Bay of Fundy not necessarily apparent on the 1977 surficial geology map based on sparse lines of single-beam echo sounder data. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {A realistic representation of 3D seasonal circulation and hydrography on the western and central Scotian Shelf has been obtained from historical observations and a combination of diagnostic and prognostic numerical models with forcing by tides, wind stress, and baroclinic and barotropic pressure gradients. The major current features-the southwestward Nova Scotian and shelf-edge currents, and partial gyres around Browns and Sable Island Banks-are found to persist year-round but with significant seasonal changes. Comparison with current meter observations shows good agreement for the Browns Bank, southwest Nova Scotia, and inner-shelf regions, and poorer agreement in the Sable Island Bank and shelf-edge regions where current and density observations are sparser and tidal influences weaker. There is significant spatial structure in the seasonal circulation and hydrography, and in the underlying dynamical processes. On the shelf scale there are substantial changes in stratification, potential energy, and alongshelf throughflow between the central and western areas, related to topography, different tidal regimes, and proximity to major water mass sources. The baroclinic pressure field is the predominant shelf-scale forcing, but there are important cross-shelf meanders of the throughflows associated with topography. The partial bank gyres are connected to the throughflows and have multiple, and in some cases, opposing forcings. Tidal rectification and baroclinic flow dominate on Browns Bank, with a relatively small wind influence on the climatology, while baroclinic flow and barotropic inflow from the shelf edge are important on Sable Island (including Western) Bank. The flows are generally clockwise (counterclockwise) over the shallow (deep) area, but have substantial vertical shear. The combination of spatial structure, multiple forcings, and other flow components provides the potential for strong sensitivity of drift to location and time.},

abstract = {There are currently three dominant approaches to fisheries stock assessment: analysis of catch-at-age data; simple models of biomass dynamics (often called surplus production models) that rely only on catch and some index of abundance; and analysis of length frequency data. A key characteristic of all these methods is that they rely primarily on one type of data and ignore most of what is known about the biology of the species in question and what has been learned from fisheries elsewhere. Other information is sometimes included subjectively after the stock assessment is complete. The first major trend in assessment methods is developing ways of incorporating all that is known about the biology of a species into a single unified assessment procedure. The second major developme)1t is in methods of incorporating uncertainty in stock assessment, using statistical decision theory. At present few agencies have formal methods for treating the uncertainty inherent in stock assessment, and therefore uncertainty is often ignored. A number of trends in fisheries management are reviewed, including adoption of formal harvest strategies, recognition that fisheries management is a matter of decision-making and risk-taking, and the use of Monte-Carlo evaluation of fisheries management options. Future trends in stock assessment and management will likely include more attention to the behaviour of fishermen in response to regulations, more involvement of user-groups in decision-making, much more allocation of property rights, including complete privatization of some fisheries, and demand for evaluation of cost effectiveness of research and management activities. Threats to commercial fisheries as now known are discussed, including growing allocation to recreational and aboriginal users, environmentalists and the impact of aquaculture.},

abstract = {The establishment of multibeam echosounders (MBES) as a mainstream tool in ocean mapping has facilitated integrative approaches toward nautical charting, benthic habitat mapping, and seafloor geotechnical surveys. The inherent bathymetric and backscatter information generated by MBES enables marine scientists to present highly accurate bathymetric data with a spatial resolution closely matching that of terrestrial mapping. Furthermore, developments in data collection and processing of MBES backscatter, combined with the quality of the co-registered depth information, have resulted in the increasing preferential use of multibeam technology over conventional sidescan sonar for the production of benthic habitat maps. A range of post-processing approaches can generate customized map products to meet multiple ocean management needs, thus extracting maximum value from a single survey data set. Based on recent studies over German Bank off SW Nova Scotia, Canada, we show how primary MBES bathymetric and backscatter data, along with supplementary data (i.e. in situ video and stills), were processed using a variety of methods to generate a series of maps. Methods conventionally used for classification of multi-spectral data were tested for classification of the MBES data set to produce a map summarizing broad bio-physical characteristics of the seafloor (i.e. a benthoscape map), which is of value for use in many aspects of marine spatial planning. A species-specific habitat map for the sea scallop . Placopecten magellanicus was also generated from the MBES data by applying a Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) method to spatially predict habitat suitability, which offers tremendous promise for use in fisheries management. In addition, we explore the challenges of incorporating benthic community data into maps based on species information derived from a large number of seafloor photographs. Through the process of applying multiple methods to generate multiple maps for management applications, we demonstrate the efficient use of survey data sets to maximize the benefit to a wide number of potential end users, and to facilitate the move toward an ecosystem-based approach to management. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The eastern Scotian Shelf (ESS) cod fishery, which displays the retrospective problem, and simulated data are analysed to provide insight into the causes and potential solutions to this problem. The retrospective problem is shown to be a result of the traditional analysis techniques and a non-stationarity in the data used in the population analysis. A moving window analysis is developed which allows the non-stationarities to be identified and in some cases rectified. Recommendations are also made for ad hoc investigations of the data. The analysis suggests that failure to correct the retrospective problem for a stock with data like ESS cod could lead to catch-level advice that would be twice or more the intended level.},

abstract = {From an evolutionary perspective, social behaviours are those which have fitness consequences for both the individual that performs the behaviour, and another individual. Over the last 43 years, a huge theoretical and empirical literature has developed on this topic. However, progress is often hindered by poor communication between scientists, with different people using the same term to mean different things, or different terms to mean the same thing. This can obscure what is biologically important, and what is not. The potential for such semantic confusion is greatest with interdisciplinary research. Our aim here is to address issues of semantic confusion that have arisen with research on the problem of cooperation. In particular, we: (i) discuss confusion over the terms kin selection, mutualism, mutual benefit, cooperation, altruism, reciprocal altruism, weak altruism, altruistic punishment, strong reciprocity, group selection and direct fitness; (ii) emphasize the need to distinguish between proximate (mechanism) and ultimate (survival value) explanations of behaviours. We draw examples from all areas, but especially recent work on humans and microbes.},

abstract = {     Existing fisheries models employ the "unit stock" concept that makes no explicit allowance for spatial distribution of biomass and effort over a fishing ground. The utility of the unit stock concept rests largely upon the "dynamic pool" assumption. However, this is both invalid for sedentary species, and diffcult to apply {\~{}}hen information on spatial distribution by statistical subunits is available, as for the Georges Bank Oat. 42°N, long. 67°W) scallop population. By reference to the Georges Bank scallop fishery, more realistic general assumptions for a spatial model of shellfish populations are:      a) Recruitment occurs in patches of random size and location with the constraint that local biomass does not exceed the virgin biomass of each unit area.      b) The fraction of effort expended within each statistical area of a fishing ground is either determined by available local biomass alone (proportional effort allocation) or in combination with" traditional fishing practice."      Therefore, a spatial model (YRAREA) simulating nonrandom recruitment and harvesting of sedentary organisms is postulated and applied to Georges Bank scallop stocks. Some of the general predictions ofthis model differ significantly from those employing the unit stock concept, as follows:      1) Under proportional effort allocation, overall yield declines more sharply with increasing effort subsequent to maximum sustained yield (MSY) than under dynamic pool assumptions. 2) Peak mortality and the apparent point offull recruitment on the catch curve occur progressively earlier in life (even at partially recruited ages) with increased effort or degree of clumping of the population, and subsequently declines with age, except where "fully recruited" ages coincide spatially with the "target" age-group making up the largest biomass component. This may be of general relevance to fisheries under intensive exploitation with sophisticated methods of naviga- tion and fish finding; peak mortality may occur earlier in life than predicted from the gear selection ogive, if year-classes are independently distributed and there is no size limit regulation. 3) Variance in biomass/unit area is predicted to fall with age.      For the Georges Bank scallop population, the model described herein predicts that a sub- stantial increase in yield would result from diversion of effort from the Northern Edge to less heavily fished areas of the bank. },

abstract = {Many factors, including intrinsic characteristics of the fish themselves and extrinsic factors of the biological environment, have the potential to regulate mortality rates during the early life of fishes.We used a detailed simulation model to rank the effects of variability in these factors on larval and early juvenile survival. Our major finding was that proportional changes in the intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the model had equal effects on cohort survival. Of the intrinsic factors, growth capacity (metabolism and assimilation efficiency), not foraging ability or starvation resistance, explained the most variance in survival. Of the extrinsic factors, predator size explained 83{\%} of the variability in survival but proportional changes prey availability had only a minor effect. Variability in prey density required a 3-fold increase to equal the effects of predator size on survival. Despite the important effects of predation pressure on survival, it had only a minor impact on how fish died. Whether fish died from predation or starvation depended much more on the intrinsic variables related to metabolism and starvation resistance and on the density of the smallest prey type.

abstract = {Interactions between spatial dynamics and stock structure in marine fishes have largely focused on stocks in decline; stock structure is rarely re-visited for expanding species. Here, the spatial ecology of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.), managed as four stocks in the Northwest Atlantic, is reviewed. Halibut collapsed under high exploitation in the mid-19th century, but the Canadian fisheries value has increased seven-fold since the early 2000s. Atlantic halibut's thermal habitat has increased due to warming, possibly contributing to its expansion. Genomic evidence differentiates two populations in the four management units, whereas there is non-genetic spatial structure within each of the stock boundaries. There are different core juvenile areas and a diversity of spawning migration patterns influenced by timing, fish size, maturity state, and distance between summer-feeding and over-wintering habitats. From tagging studies, multiple estimates of median distance at recapture (∼3-90 km) are much less than the spatial domain of each stock. Growth rates are faster in the warmer south, as predicted by growing degree day. The current perspective of Atlantic halibut spatial structure is that there are two distinct populations, and within each, there are subpopulations composed of multiple migratory contingents. The level of mixing on common spawning grounds both among and within subpopulations is only partly understood.},

abstract = {We studied connectivity patterns from a small and isolated island in the Gulf of California (San Pedro M{\'{a}}rtir Island Biosphere Reserve), as a source of propagules to surrounding Marine Protected Areas and fishing sites. We used a particle-tracking scheme based on the outputs of a three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamic model to assess the spatial domain to which the island exports larvae as well as larvae retention. We modeled the release of passive particles from locations around the island during the four release dates (May 15 and 31, and June 14 and 30), matching the lunar phases and the peak of the reproductive season for several commercial invertebrates and fish, at the time when currents in the Gulf typically reverse. For each simulation we analyzed the data at 15, 20 and 30. days after the release to represent different planktonic propagule durations. Particle dispersion was highly dynamic and spread over {\~{}}. 600. km along the coast over the study period. Overall, we observed potential ecological connectivity with a few key distant fishing sites that changed trough time, and potential genetic connectivity towards many near and distant sites, including all neighboring Marine Protected Areas, although not simultaneously. The percentages of particles remaining within the boundaries of the island tended to decline from May to June, and decreased with delayed planktonic propagule duration. The design of effective Marine Protected Areas should acknowledge the dynamic nature of connectivity patterns, for instance, by establishing adaptive network reserves to respond to changing ocean features that match reproductive patterns of target species and fisheries behavior. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {1. Electronic telemetry is frequently used to document animal movement through time. Methods that can identify underlying behaviors driving specific movement patterns can help us understand how and why animals use available space, thereby aiding conservation and management efforts. For aquatic animal tracking data with significant measurement error, a Bayesian state-space model called the first-Difference Correlated Random Walk with Switching (DCRWS) has often been used for this purpose. However, for aquatic animals, highly accurate tracking data of animal movement are now becoming more common. 2. We developed a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for identifying behavioral states from animal tracks with negligible error, which we called the Hidden Markov Movement Model (HMMM). We implemented as the basis for the HMMM the process equation of the DCRWS, but we used the method of maximum likelihood and the R package TMB for rapid model fitting. 3. We compared the HMMM to a modified version of the DCRWS for highly accurate tracks, the DCRWSnome, and to a common HMM for animal tracks fitted with the R package moveHMM. We show that the HMMM is both accurate and suitable for multiple species by fitting it to real tracks from a grey seal, lake trout, and blue shark, as well as to simulated data. 4. The HMMM is a fast and reliable tool for making meaningful inference from animal movement data that is ideally suited for ecologists who want to use the popular DCRWS implementation for highly accurate tracking data. It additionally provides a groundwork for development of more complex modelling of animal movement with TMB. To facilitate its uptake, we make it available through the R package swim.},

Striped bass YOY recruitment levels varied {\textgreater}11-fold in the 6 years examined. In those years, mean daily freshwater flows from the Susquehanna River to the bay in March and April varied {\textgreater}2-fold and controlled distribution and apparent survival of striped bass larvae. Strong recruitments of YOY striped bass were associated with matches in space and time of larval striped bass and high concentrations of zooplankton prey, especially the copepod Eurytemora affinis and cladoceran Bosmina longirostris. The strongest year classes (1996, 2003) were produced in years of high freshwater flow, characterized by a high abundance of feeding-stage larvae and a spatio-temporal match between peak abundance of larvae and zooplankton prey. Enhanced feeding opportunities were most pronounced in high freshwater-flow years (1996, 1998, 2003), when larvae and zooplankton prey were strongly associated with, and apparently retained near, the estuarine turbidity maximum. First-feeding larvae fed more successfully in a high-flow year (2003; prey incidence 91{\%}) than in a drier year (2001; prey incidence 35{\%}). A regression model that may have forecasting potential was developed to describe recruitment of YOY striped bass for the years from 1985 to 2006. The model includes spring freshwater flow and air temperatures to predict age-0 striped bass recruitment strength (R-2 = 0.65). Flow and temperature control environmental and hydrographic conditions that strongly influence spatio-temporal overlap of larval striped bass and zooplankton. The model provided accurate recruitment forecasts for 2007 and 2009, but was less successful in 2008, a year of exceptionally low recruitment.},

We use theoretical arguments and simulation modeling to demonstrate that SSCOM can, in some cases, estimate population status from catch data. Next, we use meta-analysis to estimate effort dynamics for US West Coast groundfishes before and after fisheries management changes in the mid-1990s. We apply the SSCOM using meta-analytic results to data for eight assessed species and compare results with stock assessment and data-poor methods. Results indicate general agreement among all three methods. We conclude that effort dynamics provides a theoretical basis for using catch data to reconstruct biomass and has potential for conducting data-poor assessments. However, we still recommend that index and compositional data be collected to allow application of data-rich methods.},

In most species, egg fertilization and incubation, yolk sac resorption, early embryogenesis, swimbladder inflation, larval growth are dependent on salinity. In larger fish, salinity is also a key factor in controlling growth. Do the changes in growth rate, that depend on salinity, result from an action on: (1) standard metabolic rate; (2) food intake; (3) food conversion; and/or (4) hormonal stimulation? Better growth at intermediate salinities (8-20 psu) is very often, but not systematically, correlated to a lower standard metabolic rate. Numerous studies have shown that 20 to {\textgreater} 50{\%} of the total fish energy budget are dedicated to osmoregulation. However, recent ones indicate that the osmotic cost is not as high (roughly 10{\%}) as this. Data are also available in terms of food intake and stimulation of food conversion, which are both dependent on the environmental salinity. Temperature and salinity have complex interactions. Many hormones are known to be active in both osmoregulation and growth regulation, e.g. in the control of food intake. All of these factors are reviewed. As often, multiple causality is likely to be at work and the interactive effects of salinity on physiology and behaviour must also be taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {The classical tools in spatial statistics are stationary models, like the Mat$\backslash$'ern field. However, in some applications there are boundaries, holes, or physical barriers in the study area, e.g. a coastline, and stationary models will inappropriately smooth over these features, requiring the use of a non-stationary model. We propose a new model, the Barrier model, which is different from the established methods as it is not based on the shortest distance around the physical barrier, nor on boundary conditions. The Barrier model is based on viewing the Mat$\backslash$'ern correlation, not as a correlation function on the shortest distance between two points, but as a collection of paths through a Simultaneous Autoregressive (SAR) model. We then manipulate these local dependencies to cut off paths that are crossing the physical barriers. To make the new SAR well behaved, we formulate it as a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) that can be discretised to represent the Gaussian field, with a sparse precision matrix that is automatically positive definite. The main advantage with the Barrier model is that the computational cost is the same as for the stationary model. The model is easy to use, and can deal with both sparse data and very complex barriers, as shown in an application in the Finnish Archipelago Sea. Additionally, the Barrier model is better at reconstructing the modified Horseshoe test function than the standard models used in R-INLA.},

abstract = {Understanding large-scale movement of ecologically important taxa is key to both species and ecosystem management. Those species responsible for maintaining functional connectivity between habitats are often called mobile links and are regarded as essential elements of resilience. By providing connectivity, they support resilience across spatial scales. Most marine organisms, including fishes, have long-term, biogeographic-scale connectivity through larval movement. Although most reef species are highly site attached after larval settlement, some taxa may also be able to provide rapid, reef-scale connectivity as adults. On coral reefs, the identity of such taxa and the extent of their mobility are not yet known. We use acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of Kyphosus vaigiensis, one of the few reef fishes that feeds on adult brown macroalgae. Unlike other benthic herbivorous fish species, it also exhibits large-scale ({\textgreater}2 km) movements. Individual K. vaigiensis cover, on average, a 2.5 km length of reef (11 km maximum) each day. These large-scale movements suggest that this species may act as a mobile link, providing functional connectivity, should the need arise, and helping to support functional processes across habitats and spatial scales. An analysis of published studies of home ranges in reef fishes found a consistent relationship between home range size and body length. K. vaigiensis is the sole herbivore to depart significantly from the expected home range-body size relationship, with home range sizes more comparable to exceptionally mobile large pelagic predators rather than other reef herbivores. While the large-scale movements of K. vaigiensis reveal its potential capacity to enhance resilience over large areas, it also emphasizes the potential limitations of small marine reserves to protect some herbivore populations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

These effects are often framed in terms of Hamilton's rule, rb − c {\textgreater} 0, which provides the central result of social-evolution theory. However, a number of studies have questioned the generality of Hamilton's rule, suggesting that it requires restrictive assumptions. Here, we use Fisher's genetical paradigm to demonstrate the generality of Hamilton's rule and to clarify links between different studies. We show that confusion has arisen owing to researchers misidentifying model parameters with the b and c terms in Hamilton's rule, and misidentifying measures of genotypic similarity or genealogical relationship with the coefficient of genetic relatedness, r. More generally, we emphasize the need to distinguish between general kin-selection theory that forms the foundations of social evolution, and streamlined kin-selection methodology that is used to solve specific problems.},

@article{Mordecai2011,
abstract = {1. Understanding the distribution and ecology of episodic or mobile species requires us to address multiple potential biases, including spatial clustering of survey locations, imperfect detectability and partial availability for detection. These challenges have been addressed individually by previous modelling approaches, but there is currently no extension of the occupancy modelling framework that accounts for all three problems while estimating occupancy ($\psi$), availability for detection (i.e. use; $\theta$) and detectability (P). 2. We describe a hierarchical Bayes multi-scale occupancy model that simultaneously estimates site occupancy, use, and detectability, while accounting for spatial dependence through a state-space approach based on repeated samples at multiple spatial or temporal scales. As an example application, we analyse the spatiotemporal distribution of the Louisiana waterthrush Seiurus motacilla with respect to catchment size and availability of potential prey based on data collected along Appalachian streams of southern West Virginia, USA. In spring 2009, single observers recorded detections of Louisiana waterthrush (henceforth, waterthrush) within 75 m of point-count stations (i.e. sites) during four 5-min surveys per site, with each survey broken into 1-min intervals. 3. Waterthrushes were widely distributed ($\psi$ range: 0{\textperiodcentered}6—1{\textperiodcentered}0) and were regularly using ($\theta$ range: 0{\textperiodcentered}4—0{\textperiodcentered}6) count circles along forested mountain streams. While accounting for detection biases and spatial dependence among nearby sampling sites, waterthrushes became more common as catchment area increased, and they became more available for detection as the per cent of the benthic macroinvertebrates that were of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera or Trichoptera (EPT) increased. These results lend some support to the hypothesis that waterthrushes are influenced by instream conditions as mediated by watershed size and benthic macroinvertebrate community composition. 4. Synthesis and applications. Although several available modelling techniques provide estimates of occupancy at one scale, hierarchical Bayes multi-scale occupancy modelling provides estimates of distribution at two scales simultaneously while accounting for detection biases and spatial dependencies. Hierarchical Bayes multi-scale occupancy models therefore hold significant potential for addressing complex conservation threats that operate at a landscape scale (e.g. climate change) and probably influence species distributions over multiple scales.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an important ecosystem-based management approach to help improve the sustainability of the spiny lobster fishery (Panulirus argus), but information is lacking concerning levels of lobster population connectivity among MPAs. Given their prolonged (similar to 6 months) pelagic larval duration, population connectivity must be considered in any spatial management plan for P. argus. We used genetic techniques to uncover spatial patterns of connectivity among MPAs along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef (MBRS) of Central America. We hypothesized that connectivity would be greater and genetic differentiation diminished among lobster populations within MPAs in the southern MBRS, which is dominated by a retentive oceanographic environment, as compared to MPAs in the more advective environment further north. We found that levels of connectivity are high among spiny lobster populations residing in MPAs in Central America, although overall F (ST) was low (F (ST) = 0.00013) but significant (P = 0.037). MPAs in the northern MBRS contained significantly more individuals that were genetically determined outliers or migrants than southern MPAs (P = 0.008, R (2) = 0.61), which may have contributed to the higher levels of genetic differentiation observed in northern MPAs. Direct genetic testing of larvae and adults will be required to confirm this hypothesis. The high level of connectivity among MPAs provides additional evidence of the importance of international cooperation in the management of Caribbean lobster fisheries. However, uncertainty regarding the ecological and physical drivers of genetic differentiation in Northern MPAs implies that managers should hedge against uncertainty.},

abstract = {We used a biophysical model to estimate for the first time the effect of larval drift on potential connectivity among American lobster (Homarus americanus) fisheries management areas over the geographic range of the species. The model predicted drift of larvae over distances of 50-805 km (mean = 129 km), which connected many management areas and caused marked spatial heterogeneity in retention and self-seeding versus export and import of larvae by different fisheries areas. Including mortality functions in the model resulted in less drift and settlement and had complex effects on the amount, but not the incidence, of potential connectivity among fisheries. The model's predictions received support from comparison of predicted settlement to landings 6 or 7 years later in some, but not all, parts of the model domain. Although improvements are still needed to capture larval behaviours and spatial variability in larval release and mortality across the species' range, this information is important to lobster fisheries management because the amount and direction of connectivity among fisheries can inform cooperative management strategies to sustain interconnected fisheries.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the direction, magnitude, and timing of changes in bird pop-ulation abundance is essential to enable species of priority conservation concern to be identified, and reasons for the population changes to be understood. We give a brief review of previous techniques for the analysis of large-scale survey data and present a new approach based on generalized additive models (GAMs). GAMs are used to model trend as a smooth, nonlinear function of time, and they provide a framework for testing the statistical signif-icance of changes in abundance. In addition, the second derivatives of the modeled trend curve may be used to identify key years in which the direction of the population trajectory was seen to change significantly. The inclusion of covariates into models for population abundance is also discussed and illustrated, and tests for the significance of covariate terms are given. We apply the methods to data from the Common Birds Census of the British Trust for Ornithology for 13 species of farmland birds. Seven of the species are shown to have experienced statistically significant declines since the mid-1960s. Two species exhib-ited a significant increase. The population trajectories of all but three species turned down-ward in the 1970s, although in most cases the 1980s brought either some recovery or a decrease in the rate of decline. The majority of populations have remained relatively stable in the 1990s. The results are comparable with those from other analysis techniques, although the new approach is shown to have advantages in generality and precision. We suggest extensions of the methods and make recommendations for the design of future surveys.},

abstract = {The geographically isolated, environmentally unique and biologically diverse coral reefs of north-west Australia are under threat from climate change and other localised human impacts. Similar to many other regions around the world, effective mitigation of these threats through ecosystem-based marine spatial planning is currently constrained by a lack of knowledge of the extent and direction of dispersal of eggs, larvae, recruits, juveniles or adults among the coral reefs (termed population connectivity). Here, we present the outcomes of a series of consultations between Marine Protected Area planners, managers and scientists aimed at facilitating the integration of this connectivity knowledge into effective management guidelines and policy in north-west Australia. Through this process, we first synthesised current knowledge of population connectivity in the fields of oceanography, larval biology and population genetics, and then identified and answered to the best of our ability the most useful questions for the spatial planning of Marine Protected Area networks. Key findings indicate that these systems are likely ecologically independent for many coral reef organisms, with hard corals exhibiting the most localised dispersal of species studied so far. Thus, given that hard corals are also the habitat forming species, and that more widely dispersing species such as fish are likely less vulnerable to small scale disturbance, we propose that no-take areas that facilitate resilience of hard coral populations should maximise biodiversity more generally. This means no-take areas that are large enough to encompass routine dispersal distances of corals (10-20. km), and are spaced at similar distances, will not only maintain self-replenishment, but also aid recovery after disturbance through connectivity between no-take areas. The results can be applied in a regional and wider context, and provide a valuable template for transfer of scientific knowledge into effective policy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {The efficiency of an 8-ft scallop drag was estimated from population density measurements by scuba divers. Density measurements had to be made with an enclosed quadrat because of scallop swimming activity. Scallops responded to approaching objects by facing away from them and swimming. A steep rise usually preceded level swimming at a mean height of 0.4 m from bottom. Point-to-point swimming distances of up to 4 m were recorded with ground speeds in excess of 67 cm/sec. Few scallops over 100 mm could be induced to swim.Despite level bottom conditions, overall drag efficiency was low (2.1{\%}) but increased progressively over the size range encountered (20–150 mm). Direct observations of drag function showed that swimming activity rather than selection by the drag was responsible for the low drag efficiency for the capture of scallops smaller than 100 mm.An indirect fishing mortality was established for recessed scallops buried by the drag. Dragging resulted in dislodgement of dead shell to the substrate surface, and aggregation of benthic predators in the drag tracks.},

abstract = {During stock assessment, fishery-dependent observations are often used to develop indices of abundance or biomass from catch per unit of effort (CPUE) and contribute catch at size or age information. However, fisher behavior, rather than scientific sampling protocols, determines the spatial and temporal locations of fishery-dependent observations. As a result, trends from fishery-dependent data may be a function of fishing activity rather than fish population changes. This study evaluates whether data collected from commercial fishing fleets in the Gulf of Mexico are representative of trends in fish population size. A coupled bioeconomic agent-based model was developed to generate simulated fishery data, which were used to populate an age-structured stock assessment. Comparison of stock assessment results with simulated fish population dynamics showed that management advice from assessment models based on fishery-dependent data could be biased. Assessment of fish with small home ranges harvested by fishing fleets that frequent the same fishing grounds could cause overestimation of fishing mortality. Not accounting for the spatial structure of the fishers or fish can cause biased estimates of population status.},

abstract = {Populations of tropical sea cucumbers, harvested for b{\^{e}}che-de-mer, are in a perilous state of conservation, yet there remains a paucity of information on the biology of many harvested species. We examined the population biology of the commercially important curryfish, Stichopus herrmanni, across 2 years on Heron Reef, a protected zone in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Marine Park. Stichopus herrmanni, a species recently listed as vulnerable to extinction, is a major target species for the fishery operating in the GBR. The size class distribution and density of S. herrmanni were documented for six sites across Heron Reef. There was distinct spatial variation in the size and density of S. herrmanni across sites, with no significant difference between the 2 years. The smallest individuals found were 10 cm long, some of the only juvenile S. herrmanni documented in nature. Juvenile and sub-adult populations were found along the leeward reef edge of Heron Reef, a habitat characterized by shallow channels of sand between inter-tidal coral reef and crustose coralline algae (CCA). Juvenile nurseries of sea cucumbers are rarely observed in nature, making this an important observation for understanding the recruitment and population biology of S. herrmanni. The presence of juveniles in the consolidated CCA habitat each year in autumn following the summer spawning period, and the absence of small individuals several months later in spring, suggests an ontogenetic migration or displacement of these individuals to adult habitat. The distribution of larger S. herrmanni suggests intra-reef connectivity and migration into deeper lagoon areas. This study contributes to understanding the population dynamics of this vulnerable species, a consideration for fisheries management in light of increasing global harvest.},

abstract = {Sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus on Georges Bank in the northwest Atlantic exhibit semi-annual spawning phenology, where the autumn spawn is dominant and the spring spawn is smaller and more variable. The spring spawn is thought to contribute little to total annual larval settlement on the Bank because fecundity is lower, larval development is slower and off-Bank transport is higher during spring. We tested the hypothesis that larval settlement during spring is negligible compared to autumn by incorporating spatially and temporally explicit information about spawning and larval mortality into a coupled biological-physical larval tracking model to investigate dispersal and connectivity during each spawning period. To accomplish this, we assimilated field data on adult density-at-size and seasonal fecundity-at-size as initial conditions into the model. We discovered that larval production varied in time (spring production on the Bank is half that of autumn) and space (spawners are concentrated along the advective pathway of the along-Bank gyre). Particle settlement and connectivity was reduced, but not negligible, during spring compared to autumn due to stronger dispersal off-Bank and into uninhabitable areas during spring. When mortality was made constant in space and time, lower larval production combined with slower growth during spring resulted in a minimal contribution of the spring spawn to annual settlement. When mortality was correlated with environmental variation in time and space, the spring spawn contributed up to one-third of the total annual larval settlement between the immediate upstream-downstream connected aggregations. We conclude that the spring spawn can make a substantial contribution to total annual larval production, and that settlement on Georges Bank and should be given more attention in field studies. Larval mortality has a strong influence on settlement during spring and autumn, and future field studies should focus on quantifying space and time variation in mortality in relation to the environment.},

abstract = {Data assimilation is the process by which observational data are fused with scientific information. The Bayesian paradigm provides a coherent probabilistic approach for combining information, and thus is an appropriate framework for data assimilation. Viewing data assimilation as a problem in Bayesian statistics is not new. However, the field of Bayesian statistics is rapidly evolving and new approaches for model construction and sampling have been utilized recently in a wide variety of disciplines to combine information. This article includes a brief introduction to Bayesian methods. Paying particular attention to data assimilation, we review linkages to optimal interpolation, kriging, Kalman filtering, smoothing, and variational analysis. Discussion is provided concerning Monte Carlo methods for implementing Bayesian analysis, including importance sampling, particle filtering, ensemble Kalman filtering, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Finally, hierarchical Bayesian modeling is reviewed. We indicate how this approach can be used to incorporate significant physically based prior information into statistical models, thereby accounting for uncertainty. The approach is illustrated in a simplified advection-diffusion model. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent stock assessments of Atlantic Halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus in the United States have been unable to determine stock status. Although there are several fishery-independent surveys available in the region, few Atlantic Halibut are typically encountered, the survey indices are highly variable, and a reliable index of abundance is not available for this stock. In the absence of reliable fishery-independent surveys, standardized CPUE time series from the fishery can be used as an index of abundance. Incorporating harvesters' knowledge into the CPUE standardization process can be beneficial because harvesters are knowledgeable about their fishery and target species and can provide valuable information on factors affecting catch rates and patterns in catch rates. In this study, we interviewed Atlantic Halibut harvesters in Maine to determine which covariates influence catch rates and we incorporated those covariates as predictor variables in the CPUE standardization of logbook data (2002–2017) from Maine's state Atlantic Halibut fishery. Harvesters identified covariates (fishing location and an interaction of depth and month) that significantly influenced Atlantic Halibut catchability. The standardized time series showed a stable or slightly increasing trend in Atlantic Halibut catch rates, which was consistent with most harvesters' perspectives. The results from this study highlight the value of collaborative research and provide information for management as a relatively empirical indicator of abundance.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

abstract = {Darwin recognized that natural selection could not favor a trait in one species solely for the benefit of another species. The modern, selfish-gene view of the world suggests that cooperation between indi- viduals, whether of the same species or different species, should be especially vulnerable to the evolution of noncooperators. Yet, cooperation is prevalent in nature both within and between species. What special circumstances or mechanisms thus favor cooperation? Currently, evolutionary biology offers a set of disparate explanations, and a general framework for this breadth of models has not emerged. Here, we offer a tripartite structure that links previously disconnected views of cooperation.We distinguish three general models by which cooperation can evolve and be maintained: (i) directed reciprocation— cooperation with individuals who give in return; (ii) shared genes—cooperation with relatives (e.g., kin selection); and (iii) byproduct benefits—cooperation as an incidental consequence of selfish action. Each general model is further subdivided. Several renowned examples of cooperation that have lacked explanation until recently—plant-rhizobium symbioses and bacteria-squid light organs—fit squarely within this framework. Natural systems of cooperation often involve more than one model, and a fruitful direction for future research is to understand how these models interact to maintain cooperation in the long term. A},

We conducted a simulation-estimation analysis to compare the performance of four length-based stock assessment methods: length-based Thompson and Bell (TB), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME), and length-based risk analysis (LBRA), under varying life history, exploitation status, and recruitment error scenarios. Across all scenarios, TB and LBSPR were the most consistent and accurate assessment methods. LBRA is highly biased, but precautionary, and LIME is more suitable for assessments with time-series longer than a year. All methods have difficulties when assessing short-lived species. The methods are less accurate in estimating the degree of recruitment overfishing when the stocks are severely overexploited, and inconsistent in determining growth overfishing when the stocks are underexploited. Increased recruitment error reduces precision but can decrease bias in estimations. This study highlights the importance of quantifying the accuracy of stock assessment methods and testing methods under different scenarios to determine their strengths and weaknesses and provides guidance on which methods to employ in various situations.},

abstract = {The utility of individual based models (IBMs) is that properties of ecological systems can be derived by considering the properties of individuals constituting them. Individual differences may be physiological, behavioral or may arise from interactions among individuals. The differences result in unique life histories, which when considered as a whole give rise to growth and size distributions that provide a measure of the state of the population. Early IBMs generally did not consider the effect of a spatially variable physical environment. Recent advances in ocean circulation models that include realistic temporal and spatial variation of currents, turbulence, light, prey, etc., have enabled IBMs to be embedded in model flow fields and for unique, sometimes behaviorally modified, Lagrangian trajectories to be computed. The explicit consideration of realistic spatial heterogeneity provides an additional factor that contributes to the differentiation among individuals, to variances in population structure, and ultimately to our understanding of the recruitment process. This is particularly important in marine environments where fronts, boundary layers, pycnoclines, gyres and other smaller spatial features have been hypothesized to play a significant role in determining vital rates and population structure. In this paper we will review the status of research on spatially-explicit IBMs, their successes, limitations and future developments. Examples will be drawn from approaches used in the past decade in GLOBEC, FOCI, SABRE and other programs.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Mortality of marine vertebrates due to incidental entanglement in fishing gear is of global concern. Trends in diamondback terrapin Malaclemys terrapin abundance and demography suggest that bycatch mortality associated with the blue crab Callinectes sapidus fishery may be contributing to population declines and demographic shifts of this estuarine turtle. Designing effective regulations to minimize terrapin–crabbing interaction requires information on the spatial ecology and seasonal behavior of terrapins. Our goals for this study were (1) to identify spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution of terrapins and crab pots and (2) to determine bycatch risk based on seasonal shifts in terrapin behavior and the degree of overlap between terrapins and crab pots. We documented crab pot locations and monitored the movements and activity patterns of 29 terrapins via radio telemetry in southeastern North Carolina from June 2008 to May 2009. To assess spatial overlap and resulting bycatch risk (BR), we calculated seasonal distributions and densities of crab pots and terrapins and incorporated them into a spatial overlap index model (SOI) modified to include the seasonal aquatic behavior of terrapins. Spatial overlap is greatest in warm months when terrapins are swimming in the same shallow, near-shore habitat as blue crabs. When the seasonal and semi-aquatic behavior of terrapins is incorporated into the spatial model, BR is reduced. This behaviorally modified SOI model may be applied to other geographic areas to identify areas and times of bycatch risk between fisheries and non-target species.},

abstract = {Estimating the age composition of a fish population is a critical first step in all stock assessments that apply age-structured models. Often this is done through the use of an Age Length Key (ALK), which links a subsample of fish that have had their ages determined to those that have only had their lengths measured in order to obtain an estimate of the age structure of the entire sample. ALKs can suffer from data gaps and sampling artifacts and are limited in both how they can reflect spatial variability and how spatial information can be incorporated. We propose a novel spatial ALK model that uses an approximation of a Gaussian Field and has the ability to account for physical barriers (e.g. islands, coastlines) in the study area. Our approach is compared with a previously suggested spatial ALK model as well as non-spatial approaches using both real and simulated survey data. We find that spatial ALK approaches reduce errors in stratified estimates of abundance at age over non-spatial approaches and that incorporating physical barriers can deliver more realistic results.},

abstract = {ENETIC linkage or linkage of genes is one of the common genetic features G of all organisms from viruses to man. It may be of great concern to evolu-tionary geneticists how genetic linkage was developed and how the intensity of linkage has been adjusted in the evolutionary process. FISHER (1930) suggested that " the presence of pail-s of factors in the same chromosome, the selective ad-vantage of each of which reverses that of the other, will always tend to diminish recombination, and therefore, to increase the intensity of linkage in the chromo-somes of that species. " He also recognized another agency which would increase recombination, namely, ithe constant spread of advantageous mutations which, unless they occur so seldom that each has become predominant before the next appears, can only come together in the same gamete by means of recombination. This problem was recently discussed at length but still semi-quantitatively by BODMER and PARSONS (1 962). There is a large amount of evidence that linkage intensity is under genetic control (cf. BODMER and PARSONS 1962). In Drosophila ananassue, for example, MORIWAKI (1940) identified a dominant gene, En-2, located on the right arm of the second chromosome, which enhances recombination between almost every pair of loci on the same chromosome in both males and females, while KIKKAWA (1937) found another gene (or genes) which induces crossing over in males in the third chromosome. CLARK and MARGULIES (1965) and HOWARD-FLANDERS and THERIOT (1966) also reported several recombination-deficient mutants in Escherichia coli K-12, which are probably due to single-gene mutation. Further, the effectiveness of artificial selection in reducing or increasing recombination values was reported by DETELFSEN and ROBERTS (1921), PARSONS (1958), and MUKHERJEE (1961) in Drosophila. The purpose of this paper is to present mathematical models for the develop-ment of genetic linkage and the modification of linkage intensity by natural selection. In the present paper we shall consider only those agencies which would increase the linkage intensity. KIMURA (1956) developed a model of a genetic system which leads to closer linkage by natural selection in diploid organisms, but he was concerned mainly with a crossover-reducing mechanism such as an inversion. Genetics 5 7 : 625-641 November 1967 626 M. NE1 Haploid system Model I : The modification of linkage intensity may occur in two different manners, namely, through structural changes of chromosomes and through selec-tion of modifier genes. When a structural change such as an inversion or trans-location occurs, the genes which were located far apart on the same chromosome or on different chromosomes before the change, may come close together. The present model represents this type of modification. Structural changes of chromo-somes are known to occur in fungi (cf. BARRY 1967) and in bacteria (JACOB and WOLLMAN 1961; BECKWITH and SIGNER 1966). It should also be noted that a},

abstract = {Characterizing population distribution and abundance over space and time is central to population ecology and conservation of natural populations. However, species distribution models and population dynamic models have rarely been integrated into a single modelling framework. Consequently, fine-scale spatial heterogeneity is often ignored in resource assessments. We develop and test a novel spatiotemporal assessment framework to better address fine-scale spatial heterogeneities based on theories of fish population dynamic and spatiotemporal statistics. The spatiotemporal model links species distribution and population dynamic models within a single statistical framework that is flexible enough to permit inference for each state variable through space and time. We illustrate the model with a simulation–estimation experiment tailored to two exploited marine species: snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio, Oregoniidae) in the Eastern Bering Sea and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis, Pandalidae) in the Gulf of Maine. These two species have different types of life history. We compare the spatiotemporal model with a spatially aggregated model and systematically evaluate the spatiotemporal model based on simulation experiments. We show that the spatiotemporal model can recover spatial patterns in population and exploitation pressure as well as provide unbiased estimates of spatially aggregated population quantities. The spatiotemporal model also implicitly accounts for individual movement rates and can outperform spatially aggregated models by accounting for time-and-size varying selectivity caused by spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that spatiotemporal modelling framework is a feasible and promising approach to address the spatial structure of natural resource populations, which is a major challenge in understanding population dynamics and conducting resource assessments and management.},

abstract = {Models for marine reserve design have been developed primarily with 'reef fish' life histories in mind: sedentary adults in patches connected by larval dispersal. However, many fished species undertake ontogenetic migrations, such as from nursery grounds to adult spawning habitats, and current theory does not fully address the range of reserve options posed by that situation. I modelled a generic species with ontogenetic migration to investigate the possible benefits of reserves under three alternative scenarios. First, the fishery targets adult habitat, and reserves can sustain yields under high exploitation, unless habitat patches are well connected. Second, the fishery targets the nursery, and reserves are highly effective, regardless of connectivity patterns. Third, the fishery targets both habitats, and reserves only succeed if paired on adjacent, well-connected nursery and adult patches. In all cases, reserves can buffer populations against overexploitation but would not enhance fishery yield beyond that achievable by management without reserves. These results summarize the general situations in which management using reserves could be useful for ontogenetically migrating species, and the type of connectivity data needed to inform reserve design.},

abstract = {The family Pectinaceae are the only bivalves that have been well documented as swimmers, although Ensis minor has been observed to swim. The behaviour was once regarded only as an escape response, but some studies suggest seasonal migrations are involved. Demont (1990) suggests that they swim at the natural frequency of the shell-hinge system for more efficient use of energy. The family Pectinaceae have acquired the ability to swim through the development of a specialized hinge ligament. The hinge ligament is made up of two parts: the inner and outer ligaments. The inner ligament is located ventrally and acts as a compression spring that forces the shells apart when the adductor muscle relaxes. The outer ligament is located dorsally and connects the two valves, acting as a tension spring when the valves are closed. In other bivalves, such as Mytilus, Ostrea or Tellina, the inner hinge ligament is calcified throughout, but in Pecten magellanicus it is only calcified at the fusion layer, where it attaches to the shell. The material that comprises the inner hinge ligament, abductin, is one of the few known biomaterials that exists as a one-phase amorphous polymer system. Abductin is different from other rubber-like proteins in that it contains large amounts of the amino acid methionine, while the other materials contain little or none . For such a hinge to function efficiently as a spring, it must be compliant enough to be deformed by the muscle and have a low energy loss, or damping, at functional frequencies. Alexander (1966) showed that the elasticity of the inner hinge ligament is mainly due to entropy changes, but no studies have quantified the mechanical properties of the intact hinge over normal physiological conditions.},

To understand this, one must understand that the survey time series are the essential anchor that makes modern fishery stock assessment modeling possible. Without fishery surveys, fisheries stock assessment scientists would have great difficulty modeling absolute abundance, and therefore agencies would have difficulty setting levels of allowable catch. In this review, we explore the basic assumptions that need to be fulfilled for valid surveys to be accomplished. Although these assumptions are generally well understood, the complexity of survey sampling gear and the complexity of target animal behavior makes them difficult to fulfill in practice and can easily lead to problems when interpreting survey results from even the most carefully designed survey. In reviewing the literature surrounding fishery surveys, their sampling design, modeling, and methods of analysis, it became clear that fisheries scientists have long been preoccupied with coping with the intense variability found in fish catches. This variability is found within fishing hauls, between hauls, between area, time and depth strata. Coping with this variability, which is due to animal behavior, habitat variation, and the nature of fishing gear, will be a constant theme that ties together our review.

abstract = {* Predicting and explaining the distribution and density of species is one of the oldest concerns in ecology. Species distributions can be estimated using geostatistical methods, which estimate a latent spatial variable explaining observed variation in densities, but geostatistical methods may be imprecise for species with low densities or few observations. Additionally, simple geostatistical methods fail to account for correlations in distribution among species and generally estimate such cross-correlations as a post hoc exercise. * We therefore present spatial factor analysis (SFA), a spatial model for estimating a low-rank approximation to multivariate data, and use it to jointly estimate the distribution of multiple species simultaneously. We also derive an analytic estimate of cross-correlations among species from SFA parameters. * As a first example, we show that distributions for 10 bird species in the breeding bird survey in 2012 can be parsimoniously represented using only five spatial factors. As a second case study, we show that forward prediction of catches for 20 rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the U.S. West Coast is more accurate using SFA than analysing each species individually. Finally, we show that single-species models give a different picture of cross-correlations than joint estimation using SFA. * Spatial factor analysis complements a growing list of tools for jointly modelling the distribution of multiple species and provides a parsimonious summary of cross-correlation without requiring explicit declaration of habitat variables. We conclude by proposing future research that would model species cross-correlations using dissimilarity of species' traits, and the development of spatial dynamic factor analysis for a low-rank approximation to spatial time-series data.},

Two parameterizations that prevent predictions of negative biomass are introduced, one of which allows for errors in catch. None of the parameterizations used avoid diagnostic warnings using the default sampler parameter values.

abstract = {Tropical sea cucumber fisheries follow a predictable pattern of serial depletion. Overfishing is exacerbated in developing countries where management systems lack capacity to control large numbers of fishers influenced by poverty. In contrast, the tropical sea cucumber fishery in Australia's World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) is operating in a developed high-income country with relatively few licensed fishers to manage. The development of this fishery is reviewed here in a meta-analysis of catches from 1991 to 2011. The fishery expanded to replace high-value teatfish species (Holothuria whitmaei and H. fuscogilva), fished heavily in initial stages of the fishery, with newly commercialized medium-value species such as burying blackfish (Actinopyga spinea) and curryfish (Stichopus herrmanni). These two species now constitute 80{\%} of total catch. The annual average catch of burying blackfish was 208 tonnes years 2004-11 and curryfish catches increased rapidly at an average annual pace of 200{\%} from 2007-11. This serial harvest pattern occurred in the absence of baseline studies and without independent resource assessments, information required to inform relevant harvest predictions and to determine fishery impacts. This situation does not support ecologically relevant and adaptive decision-making in management and the unfolding catch patterns in the GBRMP follow those in low-income developing countries. The missing knowledge and lack of data serve as arguments to support precautionary reductions in harvests and extending fallow periods in fishing zones.},

Recent research has investigated the behavior of operational policies that can be tailored to specific manufacturing situations through the selection and evaluation of pertinent manufacturing decision making (MADEMA) criteria. Often, however, the relationship between the relative importance of these criteria and the overall performance of the manufacturing system is impossible to analytically establish.

abstract = {Methods of assessment that depend upon commercial catch data can be undermined by misreporting or where parts of the catch, such as discards, are not accounted for. An age-structured model that makes use of survey data alone, and avoids this problem, is developed within a Bayesian framework so that routine stock summary statistics such as fishing mortality, recruitment and spawning stock biomass can be estimated with associated levels of uncertainty. It is also possible to estimate catch on a relative scale which can be compared to reported catches. The model is applied to West of Scotland haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), a stock with suspected high catch misreporting. Stock trends derived from the model are consistent with conventional assessments that use catch data during periods of low misreporting. Estimated proportions of fish at each age in the catch correspond closely with observed values. Model estimates of total catches suggest substantial misreporting in some years, though the precision of the estimates is very low. Revised estimates of natural mortality are obtained from the model that are higher than conventional values used for this stock. These new values are generally consistent with those obtained from multispecies predation modelling for the adjacent North Sea stock. The model provides many of the basic quantities used for management advice. It should not be regarded as a replacement for more comprehensive analyses, but an additional tool to explore available data when catch information is unreliable. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Aim: To address the uncertainty associated with climate-driven biogeographical changes in commercial fisheries species through an ensemble species distribution modelling (SDM) approach. Location: Northeast US Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NEUS-LME). Methods: We combined an ensemble SDM platform (BIOMOD 2) and a high-resolution global climate model (NOAA GFDL CM2.6) to quantify spatiotemporal changes in habitat of two commercially important species in the Northeast US Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NEUS-LME); American lobster (Homarus americanus); and sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus). An ensemble SDM was calibrated using multi-decadal fisheries-independent surveys (1984–2016). Statistically weighted species-specific ensemble SDM outputs were combined with 80 years of projected bottom temperature and salinity changes in response to a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (an annual 1{\%} increase in atmospheric CO2). Results: Statistically significant changes (p {\textless}.05) in habitat suitability for both species were found over a large portion of the study area. Sea scallop undergoes a northward shift over the study period, while American lobster moves further offshore. The ensemble projections showed that several management zones were identified with increases and decreases in species-specific habitat. Uncertainty due to variations in ensemble member models was also found in the direction of change within each management zone. Main conclusions: This study provides ensemble estimates of climate-driven changes and associated uncertainties in the biogeography of two economically important species in the United States. Projected climate change in the NEUS-LME will pose management challenges, and our ensemble projections provide useful information for climate-ready management of commercial fisheries.},

However, the closer the networks are placed together, the higher the probability that a catastrophe will cause extinction of the species in both reserves, thus decreasing population viability. Using a simple discrete-time Markov chain model for the presence or absence of the species in each reserve we determine the distance between the two reserves which provides the optimal trade-off between these processes, resulting in maximum viability of the species. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Survival of fish larvae is influenced by the suitability of the prey field and its variability in time and space. Relationships among food quality, quantity and recruitment have been explored in temperate ecosystems where spawning and secondary production are strongly seasonal, but for subtropical estuaries the mechanisms responsible for larval survival remain poorly identified. This study evaluated the nutritional condition (feeding incidence and AARS activity) and abundance of a multi-specific assemblage of fish larvae from a subtropical estuary in South America (Sol{\'{i}}s Grande, Uruguay) during the fish reproductive season; and related both variables to prey abundance, composition, size and fatty acids content. The larval assemblage was composed of 13 species belonging to different functional groups and composition varied seasonally. Contrary to expectations larval condition did not match an increase in prey quality. Food availability was high throughout the study period, although significant changes existed in the size and taxonomic structure of the prey assemblage. The temporal succession of complementary factors - temperature, prey composition, abundance and quality - promoted a wide window of opportunity for larvae, where quality seemed to have compensated quantity. Such combination of factors could allow an extended larval survival along the spawning season. These findings underline the importance of a better understanding of subtropical estuaries as nursery areas.},

abstract = {Deep-sea stony corals, which can be fragile, long-lived, late to mature and habitat-forming, are defined as vulnerable marine ecosystem indicator taxa. Under United Nations resolutions, these corals require protection from human disturbance such as fishing. To better understand the vulnerability of stony corals (Goniocorella dumosa, Madrepora oculata, Solenosmilia variabilis) to disturbance within the New Zealand region and to guide marine protected area design, genetic structure and connectivity were determined using microsatellite loci and DNA sequencing. Analyses compared population genetic differentiation between two biogeographic provinces, amongst three subregions (north-central-south) and amongst geomorphic features. Extensive population genetic differentiation was revealed by microsatellite variation, whilst DNA sequencing revealed very little differentiation. For G. dumosa, genetic differentiation existed amongst regions and geomorphic features, but not between provinces. For M. oculata, only a north-central-south regional structure was observed. For S. variabilis, genetic differentiation was observed between provinces, amongst regions and amongst geomorphic features. Populations on the Kermadec Ridge were genetically different from Chatham Rise populations for all three species. A significant isolation-by-depth pattern was observed for both marker types in G. dumosa and also in ITS of M. oculata. An isolation-by-distance pattern was revealed for microsatellite variation in S. variabilis. Medium to high levels of self-recruitment were detected in all geomorphic populations, and rates and routes of genetic connectivity were species-specific. These patterns of population genetic structure and connectivity at a range of spatial scales indicate that flexible spatial management approaches are required for the conservation of deep-sea corals around New Zealand.},

This involves defining management objectives and developing simple and efficient tools to achieve an overview of management needs and prioritise among these, while integrating broader conservation issues and ensuring stakeholder involvement. A new Marine Resources Act entered into force in Norway in 2009. By integrating conservation and sustainable use as basic principles, the law represents a paradigm shift in the management of Norwegian fisheries. The law indicates which concerns should be addressed, but neither how nor how often evaluations should take place. That is for management to decide. A management principle in the Marine Resources Act confers on the Ministry an obligation to evaluate whether continued fishing at the present scale is justifiable, or whether improved management is required to ensure sustainability. A Stock table, and a table of “Catches of data-poor species” constitute a comprehensive system for monitoring the management principle. Along with a Fisheries table, these tables establish a framework for developing an ecosystem-based fisheries management by providing a basis and tools for prioritising the needs of new and/or revised management measures.},

We simulated three scenarios with different degrees of connectivity (i.e., individual exchange) between the spatially variable recruitments of 36 spawning components within four subpopulations under the stock. Subsequently, the temporal trends were compared for different scenarios in age-1 recruitment, spawning stock biomass, and local depletion proportion of the overall complex stock and the individual subpopulations. Results show that increased recruitment connectivity from 0.1–0.2 to 0.6–0.8 between various components tends to increase the productivity and stability of a complex stock at local and global scales and reduce the proportion of depleted components due to overfishing. Moreover, depletions of less productive components may occur without a substantial reduction in the overall complex stock biomass and recruitment.},

Recent years have seen promising advances in methods for handling the first two together in a state-space framework, but likelihood calculations for state-space models require high-dimensional integrals, which make their use computationally challenging. The first section of this paper reviews model-fitting methods that use a state-space model structure, including errors-in-variables methods, Bayesian methods that do and do not use the state-space likelihood, and the possibility of classical likelihood analysis with nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models. It also discusses the relationship between true likelihood calculations and errors-in-variables likelihoods, as well as the role of Monte Carlo methods in implementing Bayesian and/or state-space model analyses. The second section introduces a numerical method for calculating state-space likelihoods without Monte Carlo methods and gives examples in a classical maximum-likelihood framework. The method is applicable when the dimension of the state space at each time step is low. Although recent advances in model-fitting and analysis methods are promising, inferences from noisy data and complex processes will continue to be variable and uncertain.},

Reproductive value is defined following Fisher, without reference to genetic variation, and fitness is the proportional rate of increase in an individual's contribution to the demographic population size. The mean value of fitness is the same in each age class, and it also equals the population's Malthusian parameter. The statement and derivation are regarded as settled here, and so the general biological significance of the fundamental theorem can be debated. The main purpose of the theorem is to find a quantitative measure of the effect of natural selection in a Mendelian system, thus founding Darwinism on Mendelism and identifying the design criterion for biological adaptation, embodied in Fisher's ingenious definition of fitness. The relevance of the newly understood theorem to five current research areas is discussed.},

abstract = {A common feature of ecological data sets is their tendency to contain many zero values. Statistical inference based on such data are likely to be inefficient or wrong unless careful thought is given to how these zeros arose and how best to model them. In this paper, we propose a framework for understanding how zero-inflated data sets originate and deciding how best to model them. We define and classify the different kinds of zeros that occur in ecological data and describe how they arise: either from 'true zero' or 'false zero' observations. After reviewing recent developments in modelling zero-inflated data sets, we use practical examples to demonstrate how failing to account for the source of zero inflation can reduce our ability to detect relationships in ecological data and at worst lead to incorrect inference. The adoption of methods that explicitly model the sources of zero observations will sharpen insights and improve the robustness of ecological analyses.},

abstract = {Although the study of adaptation is central to biology, two types of adaptation are recognized in the biological field: physiological adaptation (accommodation or acclimation; an individual organism's phenotype is adjusted to its environment) and evolutionary-biological adaptation (adaptation is shaped by natural selection acting on genetic variation). The history of the former concept dates to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and has more recently been systemized in the twenty-first century. Approaches to the understanding of phenotypic plasticity and learning behavior have only recently been developed, based on cellular-histological and behavioral-neurobiological techniques as well as traditional molecular biology. New developments of the former concepts in phenotypic plasticity are discussed in bacterial persistence, wing di-/polymorphism with transgenerational effects, polyphenism in social insects, and defense traits for predator avoidance, including molecular biology analyses. We also discuss new studies on the concept of genetic accommodation resulting in evolution of phenotypic plasticity through a transgenerational change in the reaction norm based on a threshold model. Learning behavior can also be understood as physiological phenotypic plasticity, associating with the brain-nervous system, and it drives the accelerated evolutionary change in behavioral response (the Baldwin effect) with memory stock. Furthermore, choice behaviors are widely seen in decision-making of animal foragers. Incorporating flexible phenotypic plasticity and learning behavior into modeling can drastically change dynamical behavior of the system. Unification of biological sciences will be facilitated and integrated, such as behavioral ecology and behavioral neurobiology in the area of learning, and evolutionary ecology and molecular developmental biology in the theme of phenotypic plasticity.},

abstract = {Gene expression is central to the genotype-phenotype relationship in all organisms, and it is an important component of the genetic basis for evolutionary change in diverse aspects of phenotype. However, the evolution of transcriptional regulation remains understudied and poorly understood. Here we review the evolutionary dynamics of promoter, or cis-regulatory, sequences and the evolutionary mechanisms that shape them. Existing evidence indicates that populations harbor extensive genetic variation in promoter sequences, that a substantial fraction of this variation has consequences for both biochemical and organismal phenotype, and that some of this functional variation is sorted by selection. As with protein-coding sequences, rates and patterns of promoter sequence evolution differ considerably among loci and among clades for reasons that are not well understood. Studying the evolution of transcriptional regulation poses empirical and conceptual challenges beyond those typically encountered in analyses of coding sequence evolution: promoter organization is much less regular than that of coding sequences, and sequences required for the transcription of each locus reside at multiple other loci in the genome. Because of the strong context-dependence of transcriptional regulation, sequence inspection alone provides limited information about promoter function. Understanding the functional consequences of sequence differences among promoters generally requires biochemical and in vivo functional assays. Despite these challenges, important insights have already been gained into the evolution of transcriptional regulation, and the pace of discovery is accelerating.},

abstract = {Levels of self-recruitment within and connectivity among populations are key factors influencing marine population persistence and stock sustainability, as well as the effectiveness of spatially explicit management strategies such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). In the United Kingdom (UK), Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel was designated a No-Take Zone (NTZ) in 2003 and became the UK's first Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ) in 2009. This NTZ is expected to represent an additional resource for the sustainable management of the European lobster (Homarus gammarus) fishery. As the first step in a genetic monitoring program, this study aimed to investigate population genetic structure of lobster within and between the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel and in doing so to assess the functioning of the Lundy NTZ in the context of connectivity and other genetic parameters. Analysis of microsatellite data indicated that lobsters within the study area are genetically homogeneous and supports the view of a single panmictic population wherein the Lundy NTZ is highly connected. Levels of genetic variability were universally high with no evidence of differences for the NTZ. Furthermore, there was no evidence of recent genetic bottlenecks, and estimates of effective population sizes were infinitely large. The results suggest that if current management and breeding stock sizes are maintained genetic drift will not be strong enough to reduce neutral genetic diversity.},

abstract = {Limited data, and the requirement to provide science-based advice for exploited populations, have led to the development of statistical methods that combine several sources of information into a single analysis. This approach, " integrated analysis" was first formulated by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Contemporary use of integrated analysis involves using all available data, in as raw a form as appropriate, in a single analysis. Analyses that were traditionally carried out independently are now conducted simultaneously through likelihood functions that include multiple data sources. For example, the traditional analysis of converting catch-at-length data into catch-at-age data for use in an age-structured population dynamics models can be avoided by including the basic data used in this conversion, length-frequency and conditional age-at-length data, in the likelihood function. This allows for consistency in assumptions and permits the uncertainty associated with both data sources to be propagated to final model outputs, such as catch limits under harvest control rules. The development of the AD Model Builder software has greatly facilitated the use of integrated analyses, and there are now several general stock assessment models (e.g., Stock Synthesis) that allow many data types and model assumptions to be analyzed simultaneously. In this paper, we define integrated analysis, describe its history and development, give several examples, and describe the advantages of and problems with integrated analysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Patterns of variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) increasingly are being investigated in threatened or managed species, but not always with clearly defined goals for conservation. In this review I identify uses of mtDNA analysis which fall into two different areas: (i) 'gene conservation' - the identification and management of genetic diversity, and (ii) 'molecular ecology' - the use of mtDNA variation to guide and assist demographic studies of populations. These two classes of application have different conceptual bases, conservation goals and time-frames. Gene conservation makes extensive use of phylogenetic information and is, in general, most relevant to long-term planning. Appropriate uses here include identification of Evolutionarily Significant Units and assessment of conservation priority of taxa or areas from an evolutionary perspective. Less appropriate are inferences about fitness from within-population diversity and about species boundaries. Molecular ecology makes more use of allele frequencies and provides information useful for short-term management of populations. Powerful applications are to identify Management Units and to define and use naturally occurring genetic tags, Estimating demographic parameters, e.g migration rate and population size, from patterns of mtDNA diversity is fraught with difficulty, particularly where populations are fluctuating, and is unlikely to produce quantitative estimates sufficiently accurate to be useful for practical management of contemporary populations. However, through comparative studies, mtDNA analysis can provide qualitative signals of population changes, allowing efficient targeting of resource-intensive ecological studies. Thus, there are some relatively straightforward uses of mtDNA, preferably in conjunction with assays of nuclear variation, that can make a significant contribution to the long-term planning and short-term,execution of species recovery plans.},

The complete elimination of sea urchins and concomitant development of fleshy macroalgal communities have occurred along different parts of this coast in different years. Macroalgal communities in areas where sea urchins died off 1, 3 and 4 years previously are compared to existing sea urchin-dominated barren grounds and to a mature kelp bed without sea urchins. Changes in macroalgal cover and species composition, and increases in biomass, density and size of kelp (Laminaria) species, characterize the succession from barren grounds to 3- and 4-year-old kelp beds. The greatest change occurred between one and three years following sea urchin mass mortality. Within 3 years, kelp beds attained a level of biomass (7.6 kg m-2) comparable to that of mature beds. Recovery of sea urchin populations via recruitment of planktonic larvae has been slow and spatially variable. Large-scale reciprocal fluctuations in kelp and sea urchin biomass may characterize the trajectory of a dynamic system which cycles between two alternate community states: kelp beds and sea urchin-dominated barren grounds. Periodic decimation of sea urchin populations by disease may be an important mechanism underlying this cyclicity.},

Fish density was higher inside PPA than in Open area for most of studies they looked at. However there were a lot of variability between all of those studies.

PPA had different effects depending on taxonomy. Lobster and scallops had positive effects in comparison to outside (scallop was more consistent and better). Echninoid seemed to have lower densities in PPA. 

Since NTR are not always politically or socio-economically good, PPA appear to have some positive protection effects on target species although NTR are better at it. 

Part of the reason why very large PPA might not be efficient is because they're very hard to properly patrol and make sure no infringement is done. It might also be because the sampling done in most of the large ones only represented a tiny portion of the MPA and thus might not be representative.},

abstract = {An understanding of the extent to which marine populations are connected by larval dispersal is vital, both to comprehend past impacts and future prospects for sustaining biodiversity. Marine populations and their supporting ecosystems are now subject to a multitude of threats, most notably overharvesting, pollution, and climate change (Hixon et al., 2001; Jackson et al., 2001; Hutchings and Reynolds, 2004; Kappel, 2005; Lotze et al., 2006). The intensity and scale of anthropogenic impacts in the world's ocean have increased dramatically during the industrial age (Jackson et al., 2001; Lotze et al., 2006), and these impacts are combining to accelerate the loss and fragmentation of important coastal marine habitats, including mangroves (Ellison and Farnsworth, 1996; Alongi, 2002), seagrasses (Duarte, 2002; Orth et al., 2006), kelp forests (Dayton et al., 1998; Steneck et al., 2002), and coral reefs (McClanahan, 2002; Gardiner et al., 2003; Hughes, et al., 2003; Aronson and Precht, 2006). The increasing risk of extinction in the sea is widely acknowledged (Roberts and Hawkins, 1999; Powles et al., 2000; Dulvy et al., 2003; Kappel, 2005; Reynolds et al., 2005), and the conservation of marine biodiversity has become a high priority for researchers and managers alike.},
annote = {Species with wide distribution probably less affected by climate change and anthropogenic effects, but connectivity can show how likely a population could be affected (e.g. if sink population is affected the metapop will propbably be fine but if source pop is affected while sink pop are not, then metapop could definitely be in danger). 

MPAs are shown to have positive effects on exploited population in their boundaries but effect on biodiversity protection has not been looked into as much.

Dispersal could be expalined by dispersal potential (kernel) and distribution of suitable habitats. Wide variance of dispersal kernel in subpop will result in multimodal patterns of realized dispersal (which will maximize persistence of metapop).

Subpop that are not connected (limited dispersal ability, geo isolation or increasing habitat fragmentation) should take conservation priority because of reduced capacity to recover from depletion or degradation.

Hard to plan MPAs using these types of models because realized dispersal distances are not well known or understood so optimal size, spacing and cumulative area of MPAs are based mostly on theories. 

Size of MPAs has been debated a lot. Smaller ones could be useless if self-recruitment is not significant (however if this is the case then benefits inside reserve should rise dramatically with size) while little benefits may be achieved when MPA size is increased larger than the size necessary for persistent populations to be maintained. 

Total area needed inside MPA to achieve maximum positive effects should increase with decreasing connectivity. Small unique habitats or endangered (e.g. endemic species) would require protection of 100{\%} of their area. Also, the lower the effective dispersal the closer MPAs have to be to provide benefits to unprotected areas between them. However, some evidence that, with several small instead of few large reserves, variable spacing is better. 

Protecting source population is way more important than sink pop, but identifying them is very difficult (hard to prove that a pop is both self-sustaining and responsible for the sustainement of another pop at same time).

Just making reserves is not sufficient for conservation, it is vital to have a plan minimizing human impacts inside and outside of the MPAs. Extrinsic sources of envi degradation and buildup of large predators can threaten the pop inside the MPA. Exploited pop seem to profit from MPA but majority of unexploited species do not appear to. Climate change also could modify patterns of larvae dispersal can also change the ideal placement of current and future MPAs.},

abstract = {IUCN WCPA's BEST PRACTICE PROTECTED AREA GUIDELINES SERIES IUCN-WCPA's Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines are the world's authoritative resource for protected area managers. Involving collaboration among specialist practitioners dedicated to supporting better implementation in the field, they distil learning and advice drawn from across IUCN. Applied in the field, they are building institutional and individual capacity to manage protected area systems effectively, equitably and sustainably, and to cope with the myriad of challenges faced in practice. They also assist national governments, protected area agencies, non-governmental organisations, communities and private sector partners to meet their commitments and goals, and especially the Convention on Biological Diversity's Programme of Work on Protected Areas. A full set of guidelines is available at: www.iucn.org/pa{\_}guidelines Complementary resources are available at: www.cbd.int/protected/tools/ Contribute to developing capacity for a Protected Planet at: www.protectedplanet.net/ IUCN PROTECTED AREA DEFINITION, MANAGEMENT CATEGORIES AND GOVERNANCE TYPES IUCN defines a protected area as: A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. The definition is expanded by six management categories (one with a sub-division), summarized below. Ia Strict nature reserve: Strictly protected for biodiversity and also possibly geological/ geomorphological features, where human visitation, use and impacts are controlled and limited to ensure protection of the conservation values Ib Wilderness area: Usually large unmodified or slightly modified areas, retaining their natural character and influence, without permanent or significant human habitation, protected and managed to preserve their natural condition II National park: Large natural or near-natural areas protecting large-scale ecological processes with characteristic species and ecosystems, which also have environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities III Natural monument or feature: Areas set aside to protect a specific natural monument, which can be a landform, sea mount, marine cavern, geological feature such as a cave, or a living feature such as an ancient grove IV Habitat/species management area: Areas to protect particular species or habitats, where management reflects this priority. Many will need regular, active interventions to meet the needs of particular species or habitats, but this is not a requirement of the category V Protected landscape or seascape: Where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced a distinct character with significant ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value: and where safeguarding the integrity of this interaction is vital to protecting and sustaining the area and its associated nature conservation and other values VI Protected areas with sustainable use of natural resources: Areas which conserve ecosystems, together with associated cultural values and traditional natural resource management systems. Generally large, mainly in a natural condition, with a proportion under sustainable natural resource management and where low-level non-industrial natural resource use compatible with nature conservation is seen as one of the main aims The category should be based around the primary management objective(s), which should apply to at least three-quarters of the protected area – the 75 per cent rule.},

abstract = {Understanding dispersal pathways and population connectivity is an essential prerequisite for devising effective fishery management strategies in at least two critical ways. The first concerns the delineation of appropriate spatial scales for management, while the second involves specification of subareas that are to be protected from exploitation and that are nested within broader management units. An understanding of dispersal patterns at all life-history stages is crucial to meeting both objectives. Spatial management units are typically defined on the basis of genetic structure, differences in morphological and demographic characteristics, fishing patterns, and/or movement and dispersal patterns of individual species (Cadrin et al., 2004). Classical models employed in single-species management typically assume that the population is well mixed throughout the management area. Today, our enhanced ability to resolve finer-scale population structure and patterns of connectivity with refined monitoring programs and advances in genetic techniques, elemental fingerprinting, and other tools (see Hedgecock et al., this issue; Thorrold et al., this issue) reveals the need to adopt a metapopulation perspective in which subpopulations linked through dispersal at one or more points in the life cycle comprise the management unit (Kritzer and Sale, 2006). Spatially explicit harvesting strategies that involve both seasonal and longterm closures of fishing grounds, and whose objectives are to protect nursery areas or spawning aggregations and enhance yield, have an extensive history and remain widely employed in marine fishery management (Kruse et al., 2002). Moreover, increasing concern over the status of marine resources and ecosystems under escalating anthropogenic stress has led to calls for a more holistic strategy for ocean management that incorporates broader ecosystem principles (e.g., U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, 2004). The use of networks of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)—areas of the ocean protected from one or more forms of human disturbance—is strongly advocated as a tactical management tool in this context (NRC, 2001). Particular interest centers on the potential utility of no-take marine reserves (a form of MPA) in which all extractive activities are prohibited. Here, the objective is to preserve ecosystem structure and function. The reserve concept therefore extends the traditional form of fishery closures to encompass wider objectives, more inclusive protection, and in many cases, broader time horizons (Fogarty et al., 2000).},

Conventionally, the surrogates used to represent connectivity in conser- vation plans have assumed the connection between two sites to be symmetric in strength. In reality, ecological linkages between sites are rarely symmetric and often strongly asymmetric. Here, we develop a novel formulation that en- abled us to incorporate asymmetric connectivity into the conservation decision support system Marxan. We illustrate this approach using hypothetical exam- ples of a river catchment and a group of reefs, and then apply it to case studies in the Snowy River catchment and Great Barrier Reef, Australia.We show that incorporating asymmetric ecological connectivity in systematic reserve design leads to solutions that more effectively capture connectivity patterns, relative to either ignoring connectivity or assuming symmetric connectivity.},

abstract = {In the Northwest Atlantic, overgrowth of the competitively dominant, native kelps by an inva- sive bryozoan Membranipora membranacea increases frond erosion, which has facilitated the establishment and spread of the invasive macroalga Codium fragile ssp fragile. To document the spread of both introduced species along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia from initial introduction points (the ‘epicentre') southwest of Halifax, we conducted video-surveys of shallow rocky habitats along the southwestern shore of Nova Scotia (100 km linear distance, encompassing the range of M. membranacea) in 2000, and then along the entire Atlantic coast in 2007 (650 km).Membranipora membranacea was observed continuously throughout the surveyed ranges in 2000 and 2007, wherever kelps were present, suggesting natural dispersal via plank- tonic larvae.Codiumfragile was observed along 95 km of the surveyed range in 2000 and along 445 km in 2007, with a relatively patchy distribution beyond the epicentre, suggesting a combination of natural and anthropogenic dispersal mechanisms. Rockweed- dominated (Fucus spp.) or mixed algal assemblages common outside the epicentre may alter the interaction between M. membranacea and C. fragile, since seaweeds other than kelp are not subject to defoliation by the bryozoan. Percent cover of kelp at the epicentre generally increased from 2000 to 2007, while that of C. fragile generally decreased. Codium fragile was the dominant canopy alga at 54{\%} of sites in 2000 and at only 15{\%} of sites in 2007. These findings indicate that, at near decadal timescales, C. fragile does not prevent re-colonization by native kelps.},

abstract = {Aim Connectivity structures populations, communities and ecosystems in the sea. The extent of connectivity is, therefore, predicted to also influence the outcomes of conservation initiatives, such as marine reserves. Here we review the published evidence about how important seascape connectivity (i.e. landscape connectivity in the sea) is for marine conservation outcomes. Location Global. Methods We analysed the global literature on the effects of seascape connectivity on reserve performance. Results In the majority of cases, greater seascape connectivity inside reserves translates into better conservation outcomes (i.e. enhanced productivity and diversity). Research on reserve performance is, however, most often conducted separately from research on connectivity, resulting in few studies ({\textless} 5{\%} of all studies of seascape connectivity) that have quantified how connectivity modifies reserve effects on populations, assemblages or ecosystem functioning in seascapes. Nevertheless, evidence for positive effects of connectivity on reserve performance is geographically widespread, encompassing studies in the Caribbean Sea, Florida Keys and western Pacific Ocean. Main conclusions Given that research rarely connects the effects of connectivity and reserves, our thesis is that stronger linkages between landscape ecology and marine spatial planning are likely to improve conservation outcomes in the sea. The key science challenge is to identify the full range of ecological functions that are modulated by connectivity and the spatial scale over which these functions enhance conservation outcomes},

Seascape connectivity and reserve effectiveness usually studied separately but a lot of connectivity studies done inside reserves show positive effects on metric usually used for MPA assessments.

Potential harm from connectivity if it helps spread out invasive species, pathogens or pollutants. Also important, for the use of connectivity in MPAs, to figure out what type of seascape promotes the highest biodiversity in general.

Using connectivity in MPAs could also potentially enhance capacity of adjacent habitats to deal with multiple types of disturbances and effects of climate change (could provide both chemical (pH) and physical buffer).},

abstract = {Connectivity, or the exchange of individuals among marine populations, is a central topic in marine ecology. For most benthic marine species with com-plex life cycles, this exchange occurs primarily during the pelagic larval stage. The small size of larvae coupled with the vast and complex fluid environment they occupy hamper our ability to quantify dispersal and connectivity. Ev-idence from direct and indirect approaches using geochemical and genetic techniques suggests that populations range from fully open to fully closed. Understanding the biophysical processes that contribute to observed disper-sal patterns requires integrated interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate high-resolution biophysical modeling and empirical data. Further, differen-tial postsettlement survival of larvae may add complexity to measurements of connectivity. The degree to which populations self recruit or receive subsidy from other populations has consequences for a number of fundamental eco-logical processes that affect population regulation and persistence. Finally, a full understanding of population connectivity has important applications for management and conservation.},

For a lot of pop, dispersal distance scales directly with PLD so it is frequently used in modelling or estimating dispersal.

abstract = {In line with global targets agreed under the Convention on Biological Diversity, the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) is increasing rapidly, yet socio-economic benefits generated by MPAs remain difficult to predict and under debate. MPAs often fail to reach their full potential as a consequence of factors such as illegal harvesting, regulations that legally allow detrimental harvesting, or emigration of animals outside boundaries because of continuous habitat or inadequate size of reserve. Here we show that the conservation benefits of 87 MPAs investigated worldwide increase exponentially with the accumulation of five key features: no take, well enforced, old ({\textgreater}10 years), large ({\textgreater}100 km(2)), and isolated by deep water or sand. Using effective MPAs with four or five key features as an unfished standard, comparisons of underwater survey data from effective MPAs with predictions based on survey data from fished coasts indicate that total fish biomass has declined about two-thirds from historical baselines as a result of fishing. Effective MPAs also had twice as many large ({\textgreater}250 mm total length) fish species per transect, five times more large fish biomass, and fourteen times more shark biomass than fished areas. Most (59{\%}) of the MPAs studied had only one or two key features and were not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites. Our results show that global conservation targets based on area alone will not optimize protection of marine biodiversity. More emphasis is needed on better MPA design, durable management and compliance to ensure that MPAs achieve their desired conservation value.},

annote = {Difference between larval transport and dispersal:

Transport: horizontal translocation between two points (ignores vertical dimension for simplicity which is very important since different vertical positions might encounter different). Seems simple but wide variability at multiple scales makes it very hard to measure.

Dispersal: spread of larvae from spawning source to settlement source. Broad dispersal requires lots of transport (restricted dispersal does not imply little transport). 

Larval mortality understudied (highest mortality for marine populations occur at early life stages).

Difference between population connectivity (exchange of individuals among georgraph separated subpop) and reproductive population connectivity (dispersal of individuals among subpop that survive to reproduce, includes larval dispersal but also influenced by post-settlement mortality).

Shorelines make things more complex. Tidal ellipses get compressed near coast in different ways depending where they are, there are flows (Gulf Stream) flowing parallel, freshwater runoff, etc.

Large-scale physical process can also influence smaller scale process and directly move the larvae. Shallow thermocline creates shear (may restrict larval transport) so modifications of thermocline (such as El Nino which creates weak stratification) can lead to dispersal variability. e.g. El Nino results in decreased water-column stratification which may result in decreased onshore larval transport.

Small-scale (temporal and space) events and processes are very hard to identify their effects on larval transport.

Although underestimated before, there have been studies showing that larvae present behaviours which can directly affect their dispersal.

Problems with sampling is that, since planned ahead, transport might not be occuring. Adaptive sampling (in response to an event or some specific circumstances) is a good solution to that but has to be hypothesis-based and is challenging, expensive and demanding.

Multiple examples proving that most larvae are not passively dispersed (compared to coal residue, dye samples, etc.).

Initial thought of broad dispersal is probably not accurate due to unexpected high levels of self-recruitment, high larval mortality rates and restricted scales of larval trasnport.

Early life history characteristics appear to influence larval survival which influences dispersal. Also seem that larger at a given age, faster growth and move through early stages more rapidly tend to be the larvae that survive to later stages.

Characteristics from larvae stage can carry over into juvenile stage but not always a positive thing (fish larvae with short pelagic duration escape predation but become smaller settlers)},

abstract = {Most applications of systematic conservation planning have not effectively incorporated biological processes or dynamic threats. We investigated the extent to which connectivity and climate change have been considered in an ecologically meaningful way in marine conservation planning, as an attempt to help formulate conservation objectives for population persistence, over and above representation. Our review of the literature identified 115 marine planning studies that addressed connectivity and 47 that addressed the effects of climate change. Of the statements identified that related to goals and objectives, few were quantitative and justified by ecological evidence for either connectivity (13{\%}) or climate change (8.9{\%}). Most studies addressing connectivity focused on spatial design (e.g. size and spacing) of marine protected areas (MPAs) or clustering of planning units. Climate change recommendations were primarily based on features related to MPA placement (e.g. preferences for areas relatively resilient and resistant to climate change impacts). Quantitative methods to identify spatial or temporal dynamics of features related to connectivity and/or climate change (e.g. functionally well-connected or thermal refugia areas) were rare, and these accounted for the majority of ecologically justified statements. Given these shortcomings in the literature, we outline a framework for setting marine conservation planning objectives that describes six key approaches to more effectively integrate connectivity and climate change into conservation plans, aligning opportunities and minimizing trade-offs between both issues. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
annote = {Very few MPA approaches have been based on expected changes resulting from climate change and its effect on species and ecosystems. In regards to connectivity, climate change will modify larval disperal pathways but will also change spawning timing, larval transport, mortality and behaviour. However connectivity can enhance recovery from those changes. 

Seems that a lot of the studies done on climate change, connectivity and MPAs are more qualitative in nature and not often directly related to measurable ecological factors. 

Underlines that qualitative conclusions should be used to inform more specific conservation objectives although preference should be accorded by those that are backed by an understanding of ecological processes which support these qualitative statements.

Many types of surrogates for diversity have been proposed but not a lot have evidence backing them. Physical seascape attribute is one and could be surrogate for ecological processes important for population persistence but few empirical studies have looked into this.},

We also show the importance of the early onset of active larval movement mediating the dispersal potential. In addition to self-recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems.

abstract = {Systematic Conservation Planning provides a clear, comprehensive guide to the process of deriving conservation area networks that will represent biodiversity in cost-effective ways. The measurement of biodiversity, the design of field collections to sample biodiversity and data treatment methods together provide baseline information on the distribution patterns of biodiversity. The book then describes methods for identifying biodiversity priority areas underpinned by the concept of complementarity. It goes on to describe how biodiversity targets can be set and how multi-criteria analyses can incorporate costs and other constraints into the area selection process, enabling trade-offs between production and protection to be made. The book finishes with a series of case studies and a conclusion that emphasizes the socio-economic and cultural contexts in which conservation planning takes place. A clear procedure is provided for identifying biodiversity priority areas, underpinned by current best science practice and sound common sense, making this volume of interest not only to graduate students and academic conservation biologists, but also planners and decision-makers dealing with natural resource management together with conservation NGOs.},
annote = {Creating reserves has usually not been done in a systematic ways organised around specific goals, although that is much more the case now. Land that has economic value usually does not get any protection (leading to no protection to the biodiversity housed inside those areas). Protected areas are usually places that had no economic value or were very remote at the time of the protection.

A systematic way of determining the importance of area is build. Stage 1 is to measure and map biodiversity. It is possible to relate environmental variables as a good estimator of species spatial distribution (some evidence of this) so would not have to survey every area ever. Still need some biological information about area in question and data from herbarium or collection not very reliable indicators (biased). 

Stage 2: identify conservation goals for the planning region. Most have been directed towards areas on basis of occurence of species (with some using probabilities of occurence).

Stage 3: Review existing reserves. Basically figure out what features are already represented in this and what is not or only partially. Also take into account the likelihood of certain species or habitats of going extinct without conservation action. Its gap analyses incorporating threat can reveal if there are biases in the current reserves that could inhibit effective implementation of reserves.

Stage 4: select additional reserves. 5 types of constraints to choose: Irreplaceability of habitat/species, cost (commercial opportunity cost, acquisition cost, ongoing management cost, etc.), commitments (areas that have to be selected anyways such as pre-existing reserves and areas with rare and threatened species), masks (areas to be excluded) and preferences (certain characteristics being preferred over others like low human density, etc). 

Stage 5: implementation on the ground. Important to identify most appropriate or feasible form of management for targeted areas. If area unexpected degraded or difficult to protect, return to stage 4 to identify replacements if they exist.Third, need to identify appropriate timing. 

Stage 6: management and monitoring of reserves.},

abstract = {The National Forest System (NFS) is composed of 155 national forests (NFs) and 20 national grasslands (NGs), which encompass a wide range of ecosystems, harbor much of the nation's biodiversity, and provide myriad goods and services. The mission of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), which manages the NFS, has broadened from water and timber to sustaining ecosystem health, diversity, and productivity to meet the needs of present and future generations. The evolution of this mission reflects changing societal values (e.g., increasing emphasis on recreation, aesthetics, and biodiversity conservation), a century of new laws, increasing involvement of the public and other agencies in NF management, and improved ecological understanding. Climate change will amplify the already difficult task of managing the NFS for multiple goals. This chapter offers potential adaptation approaches and management options that the USFS might adopt to help achieve its NFs goals and objectives in the face of climate change.},

abstract = {Incorporating connectivity into the design of marine protected areas (MPAs) has met with conceptual, theoretical, and practical challenges, which include: 1) the need to consider connectivity for multiple species with different dispersal abilities, and 2) the role played by variable habitat quality in determining the spatial patterns of connectivity. We propose an innovative approach, combining biophysical modeling with a routinely-used tool for marine-reserve design (Marxan), to address both challenges by using ecologically-informed connectivity parameters. We showed how functional demographic connectivity for four candidate reef-associated species with varying dispersal abilities and a suite of connectivity metrics weighted by habitat quality can be used to set conservation objectives and inform MPA placement. Overall, the strength of dispersal barriers varied across modeled species and, also across species, we found a lack of spatial concordance of reefs that were high-quality sources, self-persistent, and stepping-stones. Including spatially-heterogeneous habitat quality made a considerable difference to connectivity patterns, significantly reducing the potential reproductive output from many reefs. We also found that caution is needed in combining connectivity data from modeled species into multi-species matrices, which do not perform reliably as surrogates for all connectivity metrics of individual species. We then showed that restricting the habitat available for conservation has an inequitable impact on different connectivity objectives and species, with greatest impact on betweenness centrality and long-distance dispersers. We used Brazilian coral reefs as a case study but our approach is applicable to both marine and terrestrial conservation planning, and offers a holistic way to design functionally-connected reserves to tackle the complex issues relevant to planning for persistence.},

@article{Palumbi2004a,
abstract = {{\^{a}}–{\textordfeminine} Abstract{\^{a}}€‚ The movement of individuals defines a spatial neighborhood that can help determine marine management strategies. Here, I briefly review four fields of marine biology that each differentially illuminate the scale of marine neighborhoods: effects of marine reserves, tagging studies, microchemistry, and population genetics. These suggest adult neighborhood sizes for many demersal fish and invertebrates as small as kilometers and up to 10 to 100 km. Larval dispersal may be shorter than previously suspected: neighborhood sizes of 10 to 100 km for invertebrates and 50 to 200 km for fish are common in current compilations. How can small reserves protect such species? One conceptual framework is to set reserve size based on adult neighborhood sizes of highly fished species and determine spacing of a reserve network based on larval neighborhoods. The multispecies nature of fisheries demands that network designs accommodate different life histories and take into account the way local human communities use marine resources.},

abstract = {Canada's ocean ecosystem health and functioning is critical to sustaining a strong maritime economy and resilient coastal communities. Yet despite the importance of Canada's oceans and coasts, federal ocean policy and management have diverged substantially from marine science in the past decade. In this paper, key areas where this is apparent are reviewed: failure to fully implement the Oceans Act, alterations to habitat protections historically afforded under Canada's Fisheries Act, and lack of federal leadership on marine species at risk. Additionally, the capacity of the federal government to conduct and communicate ocean science has been eroded of late, and this situation poses a significant threat to current and future oceans public policy. On the eve of a federal election, these disconcerting threats are described and a set of recommendations to address them is developed. These trends are analyzed and summarized so that Canadians understand ongoing changes to the health of Canada's oceans and the role that their elected officials can play in addressing or ignoring them. Additionally, we urge the incoming Canadian government, regardless of political persuasion, to consider the changes we have documented and commit to aligning federal ocean policy with ocean science to ensure the health of Canada's oceans and ocean dependent communities.},
