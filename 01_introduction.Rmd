# Introduction {#sec:introduction}


Survey data for the Atlantic halibut (*Hippoglossus hippoglossus*) population in the North-Western Atlantic in Canadian waters was originally obtained as part of the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) summer Research Vessel (RV) bottom trawl, which provided fishery-independent indices of abundance [@DenHeyer2015]. However, as bottom trawls were found to not necessarily be the best gear to capture these animals [@Zwanenburg2003], the Industry-DFO Halibut survey was initiated in 1998 using more appropriate longline gear and using a fixed stations design wherein the number of target species (Atlantic halibut) and non-target species (anything else) per set are recorded as data [@DenHeyer2015]. The aim of this new survey was to obtain information on size composition, diet, tagging/movement and bycatch species for stock assessment purposes [@Zwanenburg2000]. The analysis of this data consisted in obtaining a stratified mean for the number and weight of fish until 2009, wherein a generalized linear model was utilized to obtain standardized survey catch rates of halibut weight [@Trzcinski2009,@Smith2016a].

These older approaches were reviewed extensively in @Smith2016a, where they were found to be inapropriate for the longline data for multiple reasons. These included the assumption that only halibut were caught by the gear, therefore ignoring the impact of non-target species and competition for hooks. To deal with this issue that could potentially bias the catch used to obtain an index of abundance, a move to the multivariate Multinomial Exponential Model (MEM) originally developed by @Rothschild1967 and later reformulated by @Etienne2013 was suggested. The switch to this model would require operational changes to the survey itself to obtain some of the information it requires, such as fine-scale information on hook condition [@Smith2016a]. Importantly, it also prompted the transition from the fixed stations sampling design to a stratified random sampling design which better fit the assumptions of the multinomial model [@Smith2016a]. This new sampling design and incorporation in the data of hook condition was implemented starting in 2017 [@DFO2021].

While this MEM showed great promise and could easily be modified to incorporate covariates [@Smith2016a], it cannot account for any spatial patterns in the data which are likely present due to the scale and environmental complexity of the Atlantic halibut management areas. Recent work utilizing geostatistics was able to harness this previously untapped source of information in the data to obtain new estimates of both station-specific and overall catch rates that incorporate latent variables through spatial methods [@Luo2022]. However, this work focused exclusively on the data from the stratified random sampling design (from 2017 onwards), leaving 19 years of data unused. Given this amount of unused data and the importance of this survey for halibut management, the Atlantic Halibut Council and DFO sponsored the extension of this strictly spatial approach to a fully spatio-temporal model that could include the fixed stations as well as the stratified random survey to provide an index over time from the beginning of the survey until current time. Details on the term of reference and on the agreed-upon deliverables are provided in Appendix 1. This report presents the models described as the deliverables alongside a comparative analysis of their output.
