# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

Survey data for the Atlantic halibut (*Hippoglossus hippoglossus*) population in the North-Western Atlantic in Canadian waters were originally obtained as part of the Fisheries and Ocean's (DFO) summer Research Vessel (RV) bottom trawl [@DenHeyer2015]. This survey provides indices of abundance, indices of biomass, and biological samples for groundfish and other components of the ecosystem. Some commercially valuable fish and invertebrate stocks are not well sampled by trawl gear, such as halibut [@Zwanenburg2003], and alternate methods to monitor abundance are used. In the case of halibut, the Industry-DFO Halibut longline survey was initiated in 1998 using longline gear to provide indices of abundance. A fixed stations design was adopted and fishing was completed by commercial fishermen, with at-sea obervers reconding data on the catch by weight of target species (Atlantic halibut) and non-target species (anything else) [@Zwanenburg2000;@Trzcinski2009;@DenHeyer2015]. The aim of this new survey was to obtain information on size composition, diet, tagging/movement and bycatch species for stock assessment purposes [@Zwanenburg2000]. The analysis consisted of obtaining a stratified mean catch per hook until 2009, wherein this stratified approach was replaced by a generalized linear model to obtain standardized survey catch rates of halibut weight [@Trzcinski2009;@Smith2016a].

An extensive review of methods to estimate catch per unit effort for longline gear [@Smith2016a] concluded that catch per unit effort standardization methods ignored the presence and abundance of non-target species and both intra- and inter-species competition for hooks. A multivariate Multinomial Exponential Model (MEM) originally developed by @Rothschild1967 and later reformulated by @Etienne2013 was recommended. The switch to this model required catch reported in total numbers of target and non-target species caught and additional information, such as the number of baited and unbaited hooks hauled back [@Smith2016a]. In 2017, a new stratified random survey with new more standardized protocols and strata that encompassed the entire management unit was established [@DFO2021]. This new survey also required the collection of hook condition data. Since then, a subset of fixed station sets have also been completed to provide the opportunity to calibrate the surveys.

While the MEM showed great promise and could easily be modified to incorporate covariates [@Smith2016a], its original formulation could not account for any spatial patterns in catch rates [@Luo2022] which are likely to exist due to the scale and environmental complexity of the Atlantic halibut management areas [@Shackell2021]. Recent work utilizing geostatistics was able to harness this previously ignored information to obtain new estimates of both station-specific and overall catch rates [@Luo2022]. However, this work focused exclusively on the data from the stratified random sampling design (2017 onwards), leaving 19 years of data unused. Given the importance of this survey for halibut management, the Atlantic Halibut Council sponsored the extension of this strictly spatial approach to a fully spatio-temporal model that could include data from both surveys to provide an index from 1998 to the present. The Term of Reference for this work (including the agreed-upon deliverables) are provided in Appendix 1. This report aims to present a fully spatio-temporal MEM and a comparative analysis when utilizing data from the Scotian Shelf and the Southern Grand Banks on the eastern coast of Canada. It further aims to assess the ability of only the fixed stations data to capture reliable temporal changes in the abundance of Atlantic halibut.
