# Introduction {#sec:introduction}


Survey data for the Atlantic halibut (*Hippoglossus hippoglossus*) population in the North-Western Atlantic in Canadian waters were originally obtained as part of the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) summer Research Vessel (RV) bottom trawl, which provided fishery-independent indices of abundance [@DenHeyer2015]. However, as trawling gear was found to be inappropriate for reliably capturing halibut [@Zwanenburg2003], the Industry-DFO Halibut longline survey was initiated in 1998 using more appropriate longline gear and a fixed stations design wherein the number of target species (Atlantic halibut) and non-target species (anything else) are recorded [@DenHeyer2015]. The aim of this new survey was to obtain information on size composition, diet, tagging/movement and bycatch species for stock assessment purposes [@Zwanenburg2000]. The analysis consisted in obtaining a stratified mean for the number of fish and their biomass until 2009, wherein this stratified approach was replaced by a generalized linear model to obtain standardized survey catch rates of halibut weight [@Trzcinski2009;@Smith2016a].

An extensive review of these methods was performed by @Smith2016a which concluded that they were not appropriate to analyze the longline data as they ignored the presence and abundance of non-target species and both intra- and inter-species competition for hooks on the resulting estimated catch rates. To deal with this issue that had the potential to introduce bias in the resulting catch rates, a move to the multivariate Multinomial Exponential Model (MEM) originally developed by @Rothschild1967 and later reformulated by @Etienne2013 was suggested. The switch to this model would require operational changes to the survey itself to obtain some of the information it requires, such as fine-scale information on hook condition [@Smith2016a]. Importantly, it also prompted the transition from the fixed stations sampling design to a stratified random sampling design which better fit the assumptions of the multinomial model [@Smith2016a]. This new sampling design and incorporation of hook condition data was implemented in 2017 [@DFO2021].

While the MEM showed great promise and could easily be modified to incorporate covariates [@Smith2016a], its original formulation could not account for any spatial patterns in the data which are likely to exist due to the scale and environmental complexity of the Atlantic halibut management areas [@Luo2022]. Recent work utilizing geostatistics was able to harness this previously untapped source of information in the data to obtain new estimates of both station-specific and overall catch rates through spatial methods [@Luo2022]. However, this work focused exclusively on the data from the stratified random sampling design (2017 onwards), leaving 19 years of data unused. Given this amount of unused data and the importance of this survey for halibut management, the Atlantic Halibut Council and DFO jointly sponsored the extension of this strictly spatial approach to a fully spatio-temporal model that could include the fixed stations as well as the stratified random survey to provide an index over time from the beginning of the survey until current time. Details on the term of reference for this work and on the agreed-upon deliverables are provided in Appendix 1. This report aims to present a fully spatio-temporal MEM as described in the deliverables alongside a comparative analysis of their output when utilizing the data from the Scotian Shelf and the Southern Grand Banks on the eastern coast of Canada. It further aims to present a short analysis of the ability of the fixed stations design to capture reliable temporal changes in the abundance of Atlantic halibut.
